Again, urge colleagues amendments--Senator Leahy joins request--to come floor debate them. big job ahead complete action bill before end week.    I yield floor.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Massachusetts recognized.    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yield myself 20 minutes colleague friend, Senator Leahy.    Mr. DORGAN. Senator yield unanimous-consent request?    Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, ask unanimous consent I--and know time being divided--be recognized next Democratic speaker following Senator Kennedy's presentation, intermingled Republican speakers well.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator wishes follow Senator Kennedy?    Mr. DORGAN. wish follow next Republican speaker.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, ordered.    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, immigration story American history. earliest days Nation, generation upon generation immigrants come part land offers freedom opportunity those willing part. Immigrants built great cities. cultivated rich farmlands. built railroads highways bind America sea shining sea. erected houses worship practice faiths. fought under America's colors wars. fact, 60,000 immigrants fighting U.S. Armed Forces Iraq Afghanistan today. Immigrants worked hard children embrace ever-widening possibilities land. over centuries, immigrants came America part globe made American dream. created Nation envy world.    That history. present future.    We heard moving immigration story anew here Senate last week Senator DOMENICI eloquently described family's immigrant roots. told parents came Italy nothing. father earned citizenship through service U.S. Army First World War. mother remained undocumented immigrant until much later life. fact, arrested immigration authorities many years coming America, gain legal status, remain country later become citizen. Domenicis worked hard, learned English, built successful grocery business, children went successful professional careers. And, know, one became distinguished respected United States Senator.    Last week, heard Senator MARTINEZ Florida family's flight Cuba begin new lives America. Young MEL MARTINEZ 15 years old family escaped Cuba seek new life freedom. millions before him, family worked hard, learned English, earned success Florida. today, MEL MARTINEZ Cabinet Secretary administration elected people Florida serve United States Senator.    There Senate seem believe immigrants criminals. fact, Frist bill that's before Senate declares undocumented immigrants criminals. Frist bill declared Senator DOMENICI's mother criminal Kyl amendment disqualify earning American citizenship.    The facts tell different story. Immigrants--including undocumented immigrants--continue strengthen fabric America thousands different ways. David Brooks observed column last week New York Times, Hispanic Americans Hispanic immigrants particular less divorce. Husbands wives stay together raise children. Even though less money Americans, spend twice much music children, spend more gifts family get-togethers, more support elderly parents.    The path progress witnessed Martinez Domenici families familiar even today. second generation, immigrant families reached middle class pay more enough taxes make up costs parents' generation. third generation, 90 percent grandchildren Hispanic immigrants speak English fluently, 50 percent marry non-Hispanics. patterns assimilation identical those characterized children grandchildren Southern Eastern European immigrants came United States 100 years ago, assimilation German Irish immigrants came here 50 years before that.    In many ways, economy more dependent immigration before. arrival new young immigrant workers helps explain America's economy grows faster aging European nations. According Aspen Institute, immigration source growth prime age labor force [Page: S2701] America next two decades. America's choice really between immigration economic stagnation.    However, even though immigration brings many benefits, doubt current system broken fails protect meet Nation's needs. borders out control time heightened concern terrorism. Millions cross borders remain illegally, creating underground society subject abuse harms American wages working conditions. Millions more enter through airports seaports visitors remain long visas expire. come remain wish work contribute, employers continue offer jobs. result, more 11 million undocumented immigrants living working America today.    Many Congress suggest answer simply more enforcement. build more fences hire more patrols solve problem.    But tried before failed. spent more $20 billion over past decade build fences triple border patrols, illegal immigration went up, down. 1980s, rate illegal immigration 40,000 people year. Today, more half million. probability border crosser apprehend plummeted 20 percent decade ago 5 percent today.    An enforcement-only approach solving immigration problems make good campaign slogan. reality failed strategy threatens security threatens American wages.    That's Senator MCCAIN proposed comprehensive, common sense plan make real difference.    An effective immigration strategy three parts.    First, enhance modernize immigration enforcement capabilities, both borders worksites. accomplish this, bill enhances capacity monitor immigration flows stop illegal entry. this, doubles number Border Patrol agents over next 5 years. builds roads, fences, vehicle barriers specific high-flow areas; adds significant new technology border create robust ``virtual fence''; develops new land water surveillance plans; authorizes new permanent highway checkpoints near border; expands exit-entry security system land borders airports.    Our bill increases capacity crack down criminal syndicates smuggle immigrants country place great risk. aid mission, creates new Federal penalties constructing border tunnels; new criminal penalties evading refusing obey commands immigration officers; new criminal penalties financial transactions related money laundering smuggling. creates new fraud-proof biometric immigration documents; increases access anti-fraud detection resources; improves coordination Federal, State, local, tribal efforts combat alien smuggling.    Our bill increases cooperation Mexico strengthen migration control Mexico's southern border deter migration Central America through Mexico United States. requires cooperation governments region deter international gang activity.    And bill reduce job magnet America creating universal electronic eligibility verification system allow employers tell individuals authorized work United States. substantially increase penalties against employers fail comply eligibility verification rules add 5,000 new enforcement agents back up provisions.    Second, address presence 11 million undocumented workers here now.    It clear going send back. Many American citizen children even grandchildren, deporting rip families apart. massive roundup 11 million people create havoc communities cost $240 billion. require 200,000 buses convoy stretch Alaska San Diego.    These families want continue working contributing communities, give opportunity offering amnesty, allowing earn right remain.    So under plan, earn legal status eventually apply citizenship, pay $2000 fine, work six years, pay taxes, learn English civics, pass rigorous criminal security background checks, back line behind those waiting patiently qualify green cards.    Unfortunately, yesterday television Senator FRIST mischaracterized commonsense proposal. called amnesty, fact nothing forgiven, nothing pardoned. Undocumented workers earn privilege legal status path American citizenship.    And plan allows undocumented immigrants jump front line, bill plainly black white wait back.    We conduct debate based fact, fiction--thoughtful policy bumper sticker slogans.    Earned legalization available criminal aliens others undermine U.S. security, fooled amendment offered last week Senators KYL CORNYN. bill already excludes earned legalization criminal aliens immigrant representing security risk United States. Kyl-Cornyn amendment exclude literally millions undocumented immigrants already living working country previously failed depart following order so. analysis DHS INS statistics suggests fully 95 percent immigrants affected Kyl-Cornyn amendment criminal aliens, exactly hardworking immigrants families program designed bring out shadows.    The third final element successful immigration strategy address future immigration. provide path earned legalization those already here. address continuing needs employers workers reality people continue come here improve lives contribute America.    In past, largely ignored realities. turned heads people come here work required remain underground economy.    The head-in-the-sand policy allowed continue. harmful workers subject abuse employers. harmful employers never know workers sent home tomorrow, harmful American workers whose wages cut employers away hiring undocumented workers lower pay.    Therefore, plan Senator McCain propose adopted Judiciary Committee provides strong effective guest worker program future. far better American workers future immigrants come here legally rights fair wages working conditions, having compete illegal workers paid substandard wages. Isn't better employer pay immigrant carpenter standard wage American workers substandard wage drives down wages everyone else? guest worker program do.    It estimated American economy demands 400,000 new low-skilled immigrants each year, current immigration system grants 5,000 visas workers. more 11 million undocumented workers today. simply enough visas go around.    To meet future needs, guest worker program takes commonsense step starting 400,000 annual quota allows quota adjusted up down future years based needs economy.    Taking realistic step free up enforcement efforts focus those yearn breathe free--they welcomed guest workers contribute America. concentrate enforcement resources those [Page: S2702] truly harm us--the criminals, drug smugglers, especially terrorists. priority time, priority McCain-Kennedy legislation.    Enhanced enforcement, earned legalization those here, realistic guest worker program future--that plan success, American people know it. plan Time magazine reports supported more three-quarters American people, support know three-part plan increases security, respects values, strengthens progress. fact, poll poll finds between two-thirds three-quarters Americans favor new program allow temporary visas future essential workers, even higher proportion favor allowing undocumented immigrants United States earn citizenship learn English, job, pay taxes.    In contrast, Time magazine poll conducted last week, one four Americans favor making illegal immigration crime preventing anyone entering country illegally remaining country working here. American people want real comprehensive reform, more immigration enforcement.    All three changes necessary address root causes undocumented immigration break cycle illegality now corrodes immigration system. three changes necessary ensure immigrant families today, past, continue live American dream contribute prosperity, security, values. three changes necessary true heritage nation immigrants.    Mr. President, suggest absence quorum.    The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUNUNU). clerk call roll.    The assistant legislative clerk proceeded call roll.    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, ask unanimous consent order quorum call rescinded.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, ordered.    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, believe going back forth, one side aisle seeking claim time, claim time side. ask unanimous consent speak up 25 minutes against time.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, ordered.    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, time country sees much outsourcing good jobs now proposal continue importing cheap labor, think strange set circumstances proposal floor Senate saying let's deal immigration immigration problem country adding immigration bill so-called guest worker program allow 400,000 additional people now live outside country come country's labor force. escalator potential 20 percent more 400,000 each year or, over 6 years, use maximum, another 4.7 million immigrant workers country.    Open newspaper days take look news: outsourcing American jobs; good American jobs pay well, benefits, retirement, health care, going China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh--outsourcing American jobs. addition outsourcing good American jobs, insourcing, importing cheap labor.    We now 11 million immigrants country here illegally. Chamber full talk days immigrants immigration bill until end week. question is, talk American workers discuss issue immigrants immigration reform? description plight American worker? here describing circumstances faced American workers? many here speaking immigrants, don't want diminish dignity worth immigrants come here over life country helped build something very unusual face Earth.    This country country made up immigrants. think everyone stands floor describe great-grandparents grandparents great-great-grandparents came here somewhere--mine Norway, example, Sweden. built Earth country unique unusual. country created standard living unparalleled world: good jobs pay well, creation middle class, expanded middle class people good incomes those good incomes allowed increase standard living.    Now see different kind circumstance country. see largest corporations become preeminent economic entities, very large corporations described different set circumstances themselves. produce somewhere else--send jobs China, example--and send product back country sell send income through Grand Cayman Island bank don't pay taxes. ship jobs overseas, ship products here, run money through Cayman Islands.    In addition that--and plenty evidence going wholesale; 3 million jobs lost sort activity last several years--in addition that, same time jobs moving overseas hurting middle class country shrinking opportunities people lowest rung economic ladder, people trying country.    Why? country attraction place want come job make money. much world, pay various substandard wages--different economies, less developed countries, undeveloped countries--and country become magnet people want come here.    I described circumstance years ago helicopter ran out gas somewhere between Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, up mountains jungles. ran out power, fuel tank empty, landed, compesinos came helicopter see came through. I, through interpreter, talked them.    I talked woman three children. describing asking life, said: life?    She said: Oh, come America; come United States.    Why that, asked?    Because opportunity is, said. job, make money, opportunities children.    That unusual. wasn't unusual hear Nicaragua El Salvador, wouldn't unusual hear parts world. immigration laws tomorrow one world's population roughly 6.3 billion want come here: Come along,    you welcome country. Come stay. Come grab job, like--why don't that? immigration laws? quotas number people allow each year--and allow people in--why those numbers? Simply can't absorb massive inflow immigration around world willing work substandard wages. can't absorb that. social services required attend it, jobs take, can't that. process called immigration people legally come country.    People come country illegally. estimated now 11 million people here illegally. heard actor--well, actually much actor--but heard fellow television yesterday CBS, believe was, doing commentary immigration. fellow wrong things, didn't surprise immigration. said: one call illegal immigration. [Page: S2703] Well, sorry, people come here illegally, illegal immigration. 11 million people here illegally.    In addition, 1.1 million people tried come southern border last year, stopped--1.1 million stopped southern border trying come country. addition that, somewhere between 400,000 700,000 people estimate came country southern border illegally last year. Finally, above number, 175,000 immigrated Mexico last year legally. addition quotas countries. fact is, very significant number come country, many come illegally.    So colleagues bring immigration bill floor President describes need immigration bill, well President Mexico. is: can't arrest detain deport 11 million people. understand that. sure know solution this, understand going sweep country detain deport arrest 11 million people here illegally. discussions portion bill amendments portion legislation. amendments employer sanctions.    I here previous immigration bill passed. presumption make illegal employers hire illegal aliens then, circumstance, pay significant fine--the employer will--and won't hiring them. job magnet come here, shut down immigration border. nonsense. didn't work. think last year three immigration cases brought administration against employers hired illegal immigrants. enforcement all. going discussions amendments portion legislation.    Let talk piece, might, piece guest worker program attached this, saying, addition things done legislation, including making legal 11 million people came here illegally giving legal status, addition called guest worker program. guest worker program proposition 400,000 additional workers allowed in. people now living outside country. allowed country 20-percent escalator per year and, way, end 6 escalator works folks come years, if, 4.6 million additional guest workers come program 6-year period--4.6 million.    Why people saying necessary? saying necessary Americans won't take jobs. can't find Americans take jobs. Well, suppose case, case? dispute that, let's assume case. One reasons those jobs don't pay enough. big businesses don't want raise salaries bottom, solution having raise salaries bring immigrant workers work less. Let's worry Americans. can't find Americans take jobs minimum wage and, way, Congress decided 8 years increase minimum wage--those folks, working poor others work bottom economic ladder, increase minimum wage 8 years. U.S. Chamber Commerce, big business, others say, need separate additional guest worker program. addition 11 million people, need guest worker program reach 4.6 million people next 6 years.    Let respond question jobs Americans won't do. research says. Construction jobs: 86 percent workers American workers legal workers. Food preparation: 12 percent illegal immigrants; 88 percent food preparation workers American workers legal workers. Manufacturing: 91 percent American workers. Transport: 93 percent. jobs corporations others Americans won't take and, therefore, bring immigrant labor, new guest workers, 4.6 million additional people.    While doing that, let's take look issue change income American people. happens measure 1979 2003. see top 1 percent American income earners doing very well--lots extra income, massive growth income. bottom fifth: growth 25 years. fact, studies    show actually lost ground. shows stagnant 25 years. same time people saying, need bring more immigrant workers take low-income jobs, people lower end economic scale country--and middle-income workers well--struggling, trying figure out, next? find good job?    About 30 years ago, largest corporation country General Motors. General Motors paid well, good benefits, good retirement, good health care. people good pay went work there, worked lifetime. Now, largest corporation Wal-Mart--Wal-Mart. first year employment, turnover understand 70 80 percent. Wal-Mart pays very low wages. believe average income Wal-Mart $18,000 year, pay very little benefits. Very few health care. think third over third health care benefits, those pay substantially more employee's share companies. come to. middle-income workers looking replacement those jobs shipped overseas.    I spoken length issue outsourcing jobs, won't today, whether Huffy bicycles Little Red Wagon Radio Flyer, Fig Newton cookies, Fruit Loom, Levis Tony Lama boots--I go forever--these jobs Americans used have, good jobs paid well, always jobs benefits--gone, gone China somebody earn 33 cents hour, probably working Shenzhen, China, 12 14 hours day, 7 days week, produce product ship back Wal-Mart, Kmart, Sears sold American public, same companies run income through Cayman Islands avoid paying taxes. interesting very good country, exactly wrong strategy long-term economic health America.    Employment rates individuals lacking high school diploma, see nearly one-half U.S.-born workers without high school diploma without job. Immigrant workers, hand, many come here without high school diploma, find work high numbers. picture immigrant workers given recently. These, way, workers came contractor hired help work Hurricane Katrina, undocumented workers came country, and--by way, hearing held this, one people testified fellow ran Louisiana construction firm. firm hired Halliburton subcontractor electrical repair work Louisiana Hurricane Katrina. Halliburton subcontractor changed mind, hired good number people come undocumented workers didn't adequate training electrical work particular base. sort thing going time, think hurting country.    So question Congress, going talk American workers? know subject immigration, profound impact American workers. going come here today talk American workers?    We told corporate strategy here can't find additional American workers without paying higher wages don't want pay higher wages want keep costs down, going import additional workers. now called guest workers. way, nonagricultural, guest workers. addition H-2A H-2B workers, agricultural nonagricultural, still exist [Page: S2704] under law. haven't even described people coming under those two provisions. people saying additional guest worker program.    I understand people listening those feel very strongly immigration bill, including guest workers, say: talking anti-immigrant. couldn't further truth. indicated think immigrants contribute great deal country. come result immigration back generation several generations family. question is: going fix issue, going balance immigration legislation proposal guest workers against needs American workers? think going here going pull rug out under American workers. don't understand all.    Let put up chart shows average wages--perhaps show New York Times story March 17, couple weeks ago, businesswoman New York. Sister Ping nickname. sentenced 35 years running one New York City's lucrative immigrant smuggling rings financing infamous Voyage Golden Venture, rusty freighter ran aground 300 starving immigrants hold. Sister Ping happier prison United States free rural village China.    Let describe persuades Sister Ping others attempt bring low-wage income earners country. typical unskilled labor wage Russia 51 cents hour. Nicaragua, 37 cents hour. China, 33 cents hour; Bangladesh, 33 cents hour; India, 11 cents hour; Haiti, 30 cents hour. suggesting short workers here. want another 400,000 plus 20 percent year 6 years, 4.7 million additional workers don't enough workers country.    What don't enough courage enough    common sense to, first, increase minimum wage second, tell those trying employ immigrant labor below standard wages, done years now, pay decent wage bottom people work, includes Americans. includes country's workers. Congress common sense, don't need guest workers. side immigration debate, extra guest workers. don't need them. need employers pay decent wage. need Congress increase minimum wage.    We need understand American workers worth. want jobs. happening good jobs being exported overseas kinds wages overseas, low-income jobs country now going filled filled immigrant labor. importing low-wage workers jobs here exporting high-wage, good jobs jobs there. telling think strategy injure country's economy. strategy hurt low-income American workers. going now. memorializes immigration bill.    I don't understand being seriously proposed. fact, President's proposal limit. talked 400,000 plus 20-percent escalator per year so-called guest workers now live outside country told come legally. Congress 400,000-person plus 20-percent escalator which, indicated, relate 4.7 million workers over 6 years. fact is, President's proposal limit all; sky limit. telling you, U.S. Chamber-big business strategy. probably good them. allows import cheap labor. probably keeps costs low. tell does: pulls rug out American workers way very unfair.    Having that, intention suggest don't deal immigration issues. do. understand that. intention suggest anybody round up even seriously consider rounding up 11 million people deporting them. going happen. Congress Simpson-Mazzoli bill passed dealing immigration. going fix immigration. Immigration problems become much worse.    This proposal, Simpson-Mazzoli proposal, described proposal attraction--the magnet--for immigrants coming country job. Take away job, take away attraction magnet.    How take away job? tell employers country, hire people here illegally, going pay real price it. going slapped big fine. going big problem.    Guess what--they didn't even hit feather duster. thing. said, last year three enforcement cases against American businesses hired illegal labor. heard one day part country. employer one big cities up near area hired illegal immigrants come construction project. caught. question was, local State's attorney, question attorney general's office others, anything going happen? No, nothing going happen. action going taken. way years. result so-called Simpson-Mazzoli bill meant nothing.    My colleagues now going really enforce things border. guest worker provision, somehow additional people coming border allow 4.7 million illegally addition 11 million here. don't understand believe allowing 450,000-plus year, 4.7 million 6 years, potentially--how going stop others want come in. inexhaustible number people working around world dirt-cheap wages. inexhaustible appetite country, businesses, apparently, hire people substandard wages. going plug border? don't see bill.    We told don't really plug border. really invite up 4.7 million additional people in, therefore cuts appetite people come in. total nonsense. going all. isn't. going undermine American workers bottom economic ladder. does. don't understand issue brought floor Senate guest workers.    I mentioned day story FDR. close that.    Franklin Delano Roosevelt's funeral being held. Before funeral, body lay State here Capitol Building, long lines view casket Franklin Delano Roosevelt. journalists trying color pieces stories. journalist walked up man holding cap hands, working man. standing long line file past casket Franklin Delano Roosevelt.    The journalist asked him: know President Roosevelt?    The working guy said: No, President Roosevelt knew me.    The question is, knows American workers now?

Senate call something else--earned adjustment earned citizenship--to try distinguish Congress done past. However, believe legislation adopted Judiciary Committee similar 1986 Immigration Reform Control Act passed Congress, everyone agrees amnesty, fairness, Senate being asked consider today likewise called amnesty.    One reason opposed amnesty, earned legalization, last time Congress addressed illegal population country, similar approach agreed upon, work. 1986 Immigration Reform Control Act, increased enforcement, both border interior U.S., especially regards employer sanctions mandated eliminate jobs magnet many illegal immigrants. addition, theory increased border security stem tide illegal immigrants coming country.    Coupled enforcement amnesty offered illegal aliens met specified requirements order bring out shadows allow acquire legal status. actually two amnesties included Immigration Reform Control Act 1986--the Legally Authorized Workers--LAW--program Special Agricultural Worker Program--SAW.    Similarly bill put forth Judiciary Committee, mandates increased border security interior enforcement well strong emphasis employer sanctions. Coupled exists two amnesties: one estimated 11 million illegal aliens currently U.S. another illegal aliens working agriculture.    The 1986 SAW Program required illegal aliens work certain number hours agriculture order obtain temporary legal status. 1 2 years obtaining temporary legal status, those agricultural workers given permanent residency status. Now, Senator seen come floor called 1986 SAW program amnesty, many maintain current Judiciary Committee proposal amnesty.    However, current agricultural program Judiciary Committee bill constructed much same way: Illegal aliens worked 150 hours agriculture 2-year period ending December 31, 2005, obtain temporary legal status, here called blue card. working 100 hours per year agriculture 5 years working 150 hours per year agriculture 3 years, illegal alien given permanent resident status. difference between program unanimously agreed upon amnesty one argued requirement [Page: S2706] illegal aliens work agriculture 100 150 hours per year. waiting time instead 1 2 years now 3 5, it. rest same.    These illegal aliens required work industry greater amount time 100 hours per year 150 hours per year. wait line behind everyone outside country trying legally enter U.S. order permanent resident status. unfair, repeat 1986 approach, widely recognized seriously flawed.    We repeat mistakes made before. one feels way. recently attended naturalization ceremony Atlanta, GA, moved see room full people over world raise right hand take oath allegiance U.S. clearly proud day people loved ones. gone through legal process truly earned citizenship. surprised number new citizens came up ceremony asked reject amnesty Senate now being asked consider. folks told felt demeans efforts made obey law wait line become U.S. citizen. realize valuable accomplishment made.    The people saw naturalization ceremony truly earned citizenship. seem fair call process those newly naturalized citizens followed ``earned citizenship'' call Judiciary Committee asking Senate consider ``earned citizenship.'' fundamental difference between two recognized rhetoric Senate.    Another problem agricultural amnesty endorsed Judiciary Committee seem remedy problem fraud prevalent 1986 SAW program. Under 1986 SAW program, illegal farm workers 90 days farm work during 12-month period earn legal status.    The illegal immigrants present evidence 90 days farm work, such pay stubs letter employer even fellow workers. assumed many unauthorized farm workers employed labor contractors keep accurate records, farm worker presented evidence done qualifying farm work, burden proof shifted Government disprove claimed work.    The Government prepared flood SAW applicants little expertise typical harvesting seasons. Therefore applicant told story ``I climbed ladder pick strawberries'' application denied those ``I picked tomatoes 92 days'' area picking season 70 days, adjust.    Careful analysis sample SAW applications California, applications filed, suggests applicants done qualifying farmwork, over 90 percent nonetheless approved.    The propensity fraud remedied Judiciary Committee's bill compounds bad policy ability unscrupulous actors take advantage it.    I think important lesson learn 1986 SAW program providing illegal immigrants work farms country benefit agricultural workforce long. History shows vast majority illegal workers gain legal status leave agriculture within 5-year period. means under Judiciary Committee's proposed agricultural amnesty, those questionably performed agricultural work past work 100 150 hours agriculture per year next 3 5 years. that, particularly light changes made H-2A program, expect same situation agriculture today.    It worth noting Immigration Reform Control Act 1986 created Commission Agricultural Workers--an 11 member bi-partisan panel comprised growers, union representatives, academics, civil servants, clergy--and tasked examining impact amnesty Special Agricultural Workers domestic farm labor supply, working conditions, wages.    Six years Immigration Reform Control Act passed, Commission found same problems agricultural industry persist: living working conditions farm workers improved; wages remained stagnant; increasing numbers new illegal aliens arriving compete same small number jobs, thus reducing work hours available each worker contributing lower annual earnings; virtually workers hold seasonal agricultural jobs unemployed point during year.    I think experience SAW program serve lesson Senate grapple handle current illegal population. believe amnesty approach endorsed Judiciary Committee far similar SAW Program 1986 same result. introduced amendment take away amnesty agricultural portion Judiciary Committee bill.    My amendment allow illegal aliens blue cards same way Judiciary Committee prescribed. However, requires end 2-year period, those blue card workers return home countries enter U.S. legal manner.    This 2-year period provides sufficient time agricultural employers organize workforce send workers home orderly manner complete work stoppage. workers enter U.S. legal temporary worker program anybody world.    They stay here specified period time time up return homeland.    We know past experience agricultural workers stay agricultural jobs long, especially gain legal status option work less back-breaking occupations. Therefore, focus agricultural immigration H-2A program. program regardless Senate amnesty, relied upon agricultural employers country near future.    My amendment provides reasonable responsible transition H-2A program, believe approach repeat mistakes past more line way vast majority Americans believe deal large illegal population.    I send amendment desk, more amendment future continue debate bill.    I suggest absence quorum.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. clerk call roll.    The assistant legislative bill clerk proceeded call roll.    Mr. KENNEDY.

Consequently, businesses sustained significant economic losses.    The fix Congress provided 2005 exempted 66,000 statutory cap workers worked under H-2B visa program prior years adhered rules returning home country visas expired. However, legislation 2 years.    As result, October 1, 2006, law expires, employers workers face same problem unless adopt amendment before today.    In order avoid problem, amendment simply extends successful H-2B visa exemption ensure program revert troubled, original form work continues permanent solution. allow small seasonal companies opportunity remain open business until new permanent fix within comprehensive immigration reform passed law fully implemented. Without modifications, employers struggle find necessary employees keep businesses running.    Before close, want clear purpose amendment. much Senator SPECTER's amendment do. Regardless, amendment create new H-2C temporary worker visa. long run, new work visa help ease pressure H-2B visa program exists today.    However, now April, current H-2B exemption expires October, few months now. Even Congress pass immigration bill signed law before then, take many, many months years before new visa programs ready accept applications. uncertainty small businesses afford.    Many employers America, such seafood processors, landscapers, resorts, pool companies, carnivals, timber companies, rely upon H-2B program. seafood industry Virginia, particular, dependent program keep business running. industry built decades earned respect incomparable products. represent traditions place hundreds years. traditions proven more successful attempts modernize automate process.

Senator Maryland recognized.    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, yield Senator Sarbanes, original cosponsor bill.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. 6 1/2 minutes remaining minority side.    The senior Senator Maryland recognized.    Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, rise very strong support amendment offered colleague, Senator Mikulski, commend once again undertaking initiative. fact, indicated colloquy Senator Warner, amendment met general approbation, believe tribute colleague worked out very skillful legislative solution difficult problem. [Page: S2712]    This very measured sensible solution real problem confronting small businesses struggling find enough employees operate during seasonal spikes workload. Many small businesses Maryland and, indeed, around country seasonal increases work. need large number workers portion year retain workers throughout year. Therefore, temporary workers become essential vitality businesses.    In Maryland, seasonal issue affects numerous industries, including, first foremost, seafood industry hospitality, pool construction industries. Seafood processors, example, busy summer early fall little work winter. businesses start out trying hire college students local residents extra workers cover need, find themselves shortstaffed. standard experience, program designed address that--the temporary employees come abroad work few months return home.    As essential part program, H-2B program, amendment colleague offers today simply extend 3 years one very successful modifications H-2B program adopted Senate vote 94 6 year ago month. Those modifications left H-2B framework intact. provided fair equitable means distributing scarce number visas.    It important--and wish underscore colleagues--to note employers demonstrate tried failed find available, qualified U.S. citizens fill seasonal jobs before file H-2B application.    The amendment approved last year, carried forward extension, three important aspects:    First, ensured summer employers disadvantaged allowing more 33,000--or more half--of 66,000 H-2B--visas allocated first half year.    Second, temporary workers lawfully participated H-2B program previous 3 years exempted annual numerical cap.    Third, modification required employer pay fraud prevention detection fee increased sanctions fraud.    Senator Mikulski seeking carry provisions forward. visas really people respect laws work hard provide services benefit economy return home families end season. essential part program.    This extension necessary adjustment small seasonal businesses rely temporary workers. recognize success one small business impacts another. ripple effect through economy helps maintain vitality State's economy Nation's economy.    Mr. President, debate larger issues involved immigration reform, urge colleagues support amendment. again commend colleague, Senator Mikulski, coming forward amendment address important issue Senate already indicated approval past considerations. very important amendment small businesses require temporary seasonal workers. very skillful legislative solution problem. commend colleague bringing forth, urge adoption.    I yield floor.    The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator correct.    Mr. ALEXANDER. ask unanimous consent Senator Cornyn allowed next 15 minutes, followed Senator Kyl, allowed up 15 minutes.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, ordered.    The Senator Texas.    Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, floor last Friday describing believed remarkable resemblance between provisions deal 12 million individuals currently United States violation immigration laws amnesty granted 1986 supposed amnesty end amnesties. words, agree 3 million people entered country without legal authorization given amnesty, worksite verification sanctions against employers hired people violation law, problem go away.    As pointed out then, amnesty granted 1986--everyone now acknowledges amnesty. second thing think everyone nearly universally acknowledge amnesty complete total failure. I, one--and believe others body--want make sure don't make same mistake twice, ask American people confidence us, trying solve very real problem, don't take attitude ``fool once, shame you; fool twice, shame me.'' don't want believe, asked believe, engaged sleight hand trick.    So believe very important colleagues focus amnesty 1986, compare proposal committee product bears remarkable resemblance.    One areas resemble 1986 amnesty 1986 amnesty bar felons people committed three misdemeanors. Senator Kyl pointed out way amendment, seek add requirement back felons people committed three misdemeanors given amnesty under committee proposal.    But bill--this enormously complex important bill--details matter. Another example reviewed committee bill over weekend, concern bill text reflect bill actually being described proponents.    For example, section 602 bill states illegal aliens comply employment requirements. specific requirements meet. Future temporary workers continuously employed, such requirement exists illegal aliens. alien potentially employed one day still end up qualifying green card put path citizenship.    I urge colleagues look very carefully bill study here found two examples bill meet description offered proponents; and, No. 2, those bill those currently here violation immigration laws amnesty, find bears remarkable resemblance everyone acknowledged amnesty 1986 everyone pretty much universally acknowledges complete total failure.    Illegal immigration dramatic effect many aspects society. affects schools, hospitals, prisons. Dr. Donald Huddle, Rice University economics professor, published systematic analysis those costs 1996 concluded estimated net cost American taxpayer $20 billion each year.    The population country stayed here violation immigration laws doubled study done. financial impact picked up Federal Government local school districts local hospital districts State local governments high $40 billion $50 billion.    Last week, heard lot debate whether immigration reform needs address 12 million aliens already here come here stayed here violation laws create new visa category allow future workers enter country legally.    As then, again now, support comprehensive immigration reform believe national security requires know country intentions once here. fear critical distinction debate being glossed over, whether work visas truly temporary whether allow migrant workers remain here permanently.    First, obviously important role permanent immigrants, support legal immigration. noted, many others have, nation immigrants, better it. support, example, moderate increases legal permanent immigration, don't support so-called temporary worker program temporary worker program, alternative path legal permanent residency citizenship.    More 23 million immigrants issued green cards 1973, average three-quarters    million new green card holders each year. role temporary workers addition those people want immigrate here permanently. feel strongly ought distinguish between legal immigration, illegal immigration, ought distinguish between people want come here temporarily work give up identity citizenship country origin those want Americans.    For those permanently going immigrating United States, sincerely want become Americans, joined cosponsoring amendment [Page: S2714] Senator Tennessee help that, assimilated, learn English, gain access kind education allow become legal immigrants, become permanently assimilated society productive citizens. think owe owe ourselves.    But role those want come here time work return country origin, people intention giving up ties country culture family want come work time return savings skills acquired working United States.    We heard lot discussion sectors economy saying depend workers come countries work temporary worker program satisfy those needs.    There criticize saying true temporary worker program futile unworkable. argue temporary workers never leave allow remain here permanently.    I strongly reject interpret open borders argument. First, think ridiculous anyone argue United States ability enforce immigration laws. put limit long visitor stay United States, long student remain United States? argument disservice hundreds millions tourists, executives, workers, students comply immigration laws.    The United States admits 500 million visitors year, fraction percentage makes affirmative decision violate laws stay here.    I believe effective worksite enforcement allow workers work during term visa return once visa expires. 1986 amnesty promised illegal workers find work, here today 5 percent workforce using false documents. will, therefore, support reform proposal unless confident illegal workers find employment United States legal channels.    If actually believe enforce law, temporary doesn't mean temporary, distinction between legal illegal, essentially raising white flag saying enforce laws. imagine great institution taking position affirmatively, expressly, tacitly.    I reject argument true temporary worker visa inconsistent natural migration patterns workers. American Lawyers Association states before 1986, average length stay United States 1.7 years. 1986, amnesty created year, length stay increased 3.5 years, up 1.7    The bottom line workers want stay 6 years, much less permanently.    Douglas Massey, professor University Pennsylvania, argues 1986 amnesty:    Succeeded transforming seasonal flow temporary workers more permanent population settled legal immigrants.    He wrote that, prior 1986:    Most immigrants sought work abroad temporarily order mitigate manage risks acquire capital specific goal purpose. sending one family member abroad limited period foreign labor, households diversify sources income accumulate savings United States earnings. both cases, fundamental objective return country origin--in case, says: ``Mexico.''    He argues--and agree--that 1986 amnesty actually resulted decrease circular migration.    The committee amendment floor exactly same thing. destroy incentive circular migration benefits accrue--not United States country origin, whence immigrant return savings skills acquired here.    In survey Pew Hispanic Center Mexicans Abroad, support argument migrant workers participate true temporary worker program. Indeed, 71 percent those surveyed, 5,000 applicants matriculator consular card United States, 71 percent participate temporary worker program, even knew end period visas, return country origin.    Finally, country enjoying strong period economic growth. economy created quarter million jobs February created 2.1 million jobs over past 12 months--almost 5 million new jobs August 2003. unemployment rate 4.8 percent, lower average 1970s, 1980s, 1990s. always enjoy strong economy, true temporary worker program allows visa policy adapt peaks valleys economic needs.    I supported Senator Kyl's amendment committee limit number temporary worker visas unemployment reaches certain levels. amendment means nothing workers green cards path legal permanent residency citizenship.    Everyone, seems, describes proposal guest worker temporary worker program. temporary worker programs--or those sold under guise temporary worker program--are, fact, temporary. important, both economy American native-born workers compete new workforce, modulate moderate flow workers country time economy sustain take jobs away people born here legal immigrants. critical recognize importance restoration circular migration patterns which, fact, benefit countries such Mexico Central America literally being hollowed out: People permanently leaving those countries, making difficult generate jobs grow economy, people stay home wish leave family culture country order come United States sustain themselves families.    My point colleagues those news media American people listening listen carefully people call different sort worker programs visas actually function, insist colleagues going call guest worker program temporary worker program, is, fact, temporary; guest program, someone going permanently move us. Guests, fact, ultimately supposed return stay.    I realize time short portion debate, want make those points. know colleagues floor wish speak, return make additional comments aspects bill later time.    I yield floor.    Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Arizona, next 15 minutes, generously agreed allow Senator Alabama up 3 minutes. ask unanimous consent agreement modified Senator Alabama 3 minutes, Senator Kyl 15 minutes, 15 minutes Senator Kyl.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, ordered.    Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, very fine hearing morning. think five Federal judges, Department Justice represented, professor, deal problem immigration system. Senator Cornyn    has rightly bill bill bill, say? Chairman Specter's mark, dealt crisis appeals immigration. During course committee markup, amendment offered wasn't good whatever, struck reform. bill Judiciary markup bill floor action whatsoever deal problem.    Since 2001, 601-percent increase appeals, Bureau Appeals, immigration appeals cases. Six times increased year 2000. [Page: S2715] now takes, average, 27 months one those cases handled backlog.    Judge Bea Ninth Circuit Court Appeals, one biggest backlogs circuit, morning:    Second, petitioners attorneys see appeals piling up circuit courts, realize appeals delayed. During period delay, events change alien's chances staying country. Those changes personal, such marriage U.S. citizen birth child, number conditions affect removability. those changes political, such change country conditions alien's home country, legislative administrative, such immigration reform country, giving alien new hopes remain here. Even appeal lacks merit, backlog cases circuit court provides incentive appeal guaranteeing delay deportation, now average 27 months.    What colleagues is, going something--and should--we confront problem those here illegally handle humane fair decent way. promise same time going fix system broken today--Senator Harry Reid down border chaos laws unenforceable. examples it. Senator Specter language fix it. language stripped out. nothing bill before deal problem. example gaping holes remain legislation.    I yield floor.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under previous order, Senator Arizona recognized.    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Cornyn introduced legislation comprehensive nature, wish briefly describe key provisions legislation believe opportunity vote amendment pending bill point during procedure.    In significant part, bill before embodies many provisions legislation deal border security. want emphasize beginning agree first step take dealing comprehensive immigration reform securing border. going take time done. going take money going take will. provisions bill provide significant sum money more Border Patrol agents, more fencing--it wall, provide additional fencing--and provides high technology help border security, including unmanned aerial vehicles, sensors, cameras, things sort.    It requires Department Homeland Security acquire more detention spaces people come here countries Mexico and, therefore, can't returned border, actually detained pending removal country. Today, illegal immigrant China, example, can't take down border Mexico drop there; send back China. costs lot money. takes long time. fact, Chinese Government very slow take Chinese citizens back. now 39,000 Chinese citizens apprehended came here illegally, returned China. don't detention space them, released recognizance. idea many show up time go? smart ones don't show up, obviously. need more detention space, part legislation. key point provide funding authorization necessary handle controlling border deal apprehensions occur result that.    The next thing provide more internal enforcement, different parts Department Homeland Security responsibility enforcing law interior. Today, illegal immigrant knows 60 miles north border, literally home free new home don't law enforcement officials anything it. especially difficult employment    site. know, laws against hiring illegal immigrants, enforced. think something three actions brought last year against many million employers country. bottom line need enforcement mechanism ensure whoever entitled employed here, employer verify eligibility, easy do, foolproof.    So another part legislation provide mechanism whereby Government, employer, decides eligible employed. Anybody forged documents today walk employer hired, employer can't look behind those documents see whether forgery. burden Government, particularly simplest way verify eligibility good Social Security number, bill provides for. Social Security database today is, frankly, mess. needs cleaned up. cleaned up don't 10 different people using same phony number. fact, over 100,000 people today using number 000-00-0000. doesn't take real bright person figure out something wrong situation.    So database cleaned up employer simply law--and Cornyn-Kyl bill requires--type number given respective employee determine electronically whether valid number. electronic message comes back valid number, don't hire person going big trouble under bill. comes back valid number, one thing do, match number individual standing before you. done couple mechanisms: driver's license, and--depending upon gets written bill--with date birth place-of-birth verification information well. verifying employee's eligibility under law individual applying job person number. Those key components legislation introduced.    We think important two key things. provide work requirements future, temporary worker program. forget moment illegal immigrants already here. Cornyn-Kyl bill going create new temporary program unskilled labor such skilled labor today. Today computer company need more software designers can't American universities, apply under special American program temporary workers come China India wherever come from. here temporary period time. need those workers, apply visas, jobs those kinds temporary workers, visas issued. depends upon whether job available can't find American do.    We more regard unskilled laborers present more potential problems society times go bad don't job. unskilled, less educated workers, need same kind temporary status, permanent status. If, example, construction industry--and statistic here cite moment--but lot illegal immigrants working construction today. State Arizona, can't find enough people build homes, such housing boom right now. Under program, issuing more temporary work visas people come help build homes. know many times lived Arizona good American citizen good carpentry skills can't find job. jobs had. housing market fallen through floor recession people looking work can't find it. situation doesn't make sense issue more temporary work visas foreign workers, foreign construction workers    In case wouldn't issue those permits [Page: S2716] job here. Under notion willing worker willing employer, clearly don't job, don't want issuing work permits.    Our program designed flexible enough issue permits need workers issue visas don't need workers.    Contrast bill before us. such flexibility. number visas set, doesn't matter whether job individual. People still come country, entitled stay here forever, permanently. even put path citizenship, even job here them. right. bill, distinguished that, temporary periods time only.    Then, finally deal illegal immigrants here already could, way, join up temporary worker program. don't penalize prevent doing that. bills proposals looked at, including Cornyn-Kyl proposal, provide effective date, illegal immigrants here go check someplace. different places check in, bottom line turn bad documents new document enable stay United States period time. bill 5 years. President proposed total 3 plus 3, 6 years. Kennedy McCain bill part bill before another period time. check temporary visa. Here, good period time. travel back forth during period time restriction. fine. allow person stay here up 5 years.    We one thing. background check provided bill. Under bill before us, background check followed up. say, criminal, doesn't matter. still participate program. Under Cornyn-Kyl program, participate program criminal. amendment pending make case bill Senate floor well, people so-called absconders--they violated judge's order leave country committed felony three misdemeanors--would entitled participate program.    In event, under Cornyn-Kyl bill allowed stay country up 5 years. return home country time start participating temporary worker program. stay here full 5 years, working. But, want go home, example, Mexico laser visa, required, matter days, less week. job American employer, take certificate employment. leave United States, go consular office Mexico, obtain laser visa, present border come back United States resume work. whole thing take more week, probably less that.    There those say: people voluntarily participate program? think fairly evident. provide incentives people participate it. sooner leave United States laser visa come work temporarily, longer work temporary work program. provide visas up 2 years time. total 6 years' worth temporary work United States. sooner start process, obviously, sooner start working under temporary worker program.    What hard that? addition, take you, finished temporary worker status, money accumulated savings account paid through system parallel Social Security system today. pay system, personal account, take money voluntarily depart United States temporary visa expires--or before want to. incentives people comply law.    Finally, question people report deported? make crystal clear bill deportation. don't know legislation talking about. even sure such thing House bill. event, Cornyn-Kyl bill provision deportation. doesn't require people report deported--nothing kind. same kind check-in present bills. check in, temporary document enables stay country, and, again, up 5 years.    There Pew Hispanic research poll Mexican immigrants here, illegal, opportunity continue work here up 5 years--7    percent willing return home.    I think myth someone came here simply work earn money family, let's Mexico El Salvador whatever country want make it, unwilling return home under relatively generous provisions established legislation.    There disincentives stay beyond time incentives leave within period time. entitled become temporary worker and, therefore, seems me, ascribing pretty bad motive people voluntarily return home. fact, extent people hard-working folks came here work make money, willing accept therefore think don't sudden change mind here say: leaving matter make law be.    If folks otherwise law-abiding folks, think want comply law set out.    The bottom line is, Cornyn-Kyl bill provides way temporary workers work United States. provides way people came here illegally become legal, stay here up 5 years, want, continue participate worker program that, and, finally, decide want become legal permanent residents therefore citizens United States, nothing prohibits applying well. same way apply today. wouldn't given advantage, given disadvantage under Cornyn-Kyl legislation.    Might inquire, under unanimous consent agreement 15 minutes time. much time have?    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Arizona 1 minute remaining.    Mr. KYL. happy summarize. bottom line going opportunity vote several different alternative proposals. Cornyn-Kyl proposal one vote for. believe provides reasonable alternative proposal floor. treats people humanely fairly doesn't provide people stay here permanently job them, certainly history know times economy good now, job everyone.    Temporary work status, treating people humanely fairly, providing enforcement workplace, and, importantly, enforcement border, think good proposition. hope time comes consider alternatives, colleagues give good opportunity, discuss thoroughly, agree good alternative discussing.    Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, ask unanimous consent agreement modified permit Senator Alaska speak 3 minutes before 15 minutes.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, ordered.    The Senator Alaska.    AMENDMENT NO. 3217 AMENDMENT NO. 3192    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, join Senator Mikulski cosponsoring amendment great importance State Alaska.    Seasonal workers vital Nation's economy. Without services [Page: S2717] workers provide, many businesses cease operate. visas particularly important seafood hospitality industries.    Currently, United States caps H-2B visas 66,000 per year. Last year, Congress adopted ``Save Small Businesses Act,'' allocates seasonal visas more equitably between winter summer months. exempts certain returning Seasonal Workers cap, making more visas available new workers.    Prior act's adoption, H-2B visa cap met during winter months, well before summer season, resulting lack available visas much needed summer workers seafood hospitality industry.    Alaska's salmon industry especially vulnerable enough temporary seasonal visas summer months.    Salmon roe product overseen Japanese ``Supervisor Technicians'' grade salmon roe prior sale Japanese consumers. Due particular grading processing demands roe, without technicians special certification, Japanese buy Alaskan roe.    In cases value roe greater flesh fish, imagine important salmon industry technicians certifications each year.    Senator Mikulski's amendment simply extends 2009 ``Save Small Businesses Act.'' Securing reasonable number visas seasonal industries absolutely necessary.    I urge Senate vote favor amendment.    AMENDMENT NO. 3193, MODIFIED, AMENDMENT NO. 3192    Mr. ALEXANDER.

Otherwise, those jobs go India, China, parts world.    We many principles stake. Here exactly amendment voting afternoon Senator Bingaman's amendment. First, help legal immigrants embarked path toward citizenship learn common language--English--our history, way Government provisions.    One, providing $500 grant English course. great many people here want learn English. think myth those people come country don't want learn English. older people come here, harder. 2004, 1.142 million individuals participated English literacy programs designed help improve English language immigrants. Seventy-one percent those participants Hispanics. Twenty-eight percent English literacy adult education programs reported having waiting lists. Thirty-five percent those reported lists 50 more people waiting lists. lot people here want learn common language, want learn common language. important unite country that.    Second, allow those become fluent English--not basic English fluent    proficient English--to apply citizenship 1 year early; is, 4 years instead 5. major change. order become citizen, one here 5 years under present rules. One good character pass test Constitution principles. None changes.

One-half million million new Americans year take oath. renounce come from, pledge allegiance coming. course, proud came from, prouder still Americans. provision puts law. essentially same oath George Washington himself took 1778 Valley Forge administered officers. same oath millions upon millions new citizens country taken 200 years. dignify make part law.    In addition, amendment asks Department Homeland Security work National Archives, National Park Service, others carry out strategy highlight ceremonies immigrants become American citizens.    I many those ceremonies. more moving experience anywhere America--and events happen virtually day Federal courthouse, 30, 45, 70 prospective citizens arrive courthouse. judge something country means, men women country, neatly dressed, many tears eyes, raise hands, having here 5 years, shown good character, learned English, passed test Constitution renounce allegiance come pledge allegiance country. Those ceremonies highlighted.    Finally, establishes award recognize contributions outstanding new American citizens.    I suspect new award one day, perhaps very quickly, become important Presidential Medal Freedom hard find outstanding contributions new immigrants country.    I see Senator New Mexico floor. heard 100 Americans won Nobel Prize physics, 60 immigrants children immigrants. Each knows such list, President identify up 10 such immigrants made great contributions country recognize year make difference.    How much cost? won't cost taxpayers penny grants help people learn English, major cost, paid visa fees paid each year.    This important amendment. believe important subject before us: helping prospective citizens learn English, giving incentive become citizen 4 years instead 5, become proficient English, providing grants encourage teaching American history civics, creating new foundation assist that, codifying oath allegiance, highlighting ceremonies citizens become new Americans, allowing President designate handful new Americans year contributed much country.    During next few weeks, enact legislation secure borders. create legal status workers students. welcome increase standard living, well export values. complete work comprehensive immigration law without remembering placed three-word motto above Presiding Officer's Chair, without remembering unity come without lot effort, without noticing lessons overseas France Great Britain remind more important today help prospective citizens become Americans.    I notice Senator New Mexico floor. majority time remaining, Senator Pennsylvania discuss it. glad yield time Senator New Mexico discuss amendment.    Mr. SPECTER.

Today, estimated more 11 million undocumented aliens living country.    The American people welcoming generous people. those enter country illegally, those employ them, disrespect rule law. live age terrorists challenging borders, simply allow people pour United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked. Americans right demand better border security better enforcement immigration laws.    The bill Judiciary Committee passed clearly strengthen enforcement. repeat that, those arguing against Judiciary Committee bill contrast bill strong enforcement bill. bill Judiciary Committee passed clearly strengthens enforcement.    To begin with, agencies charged border [Page: S2723] security receive new technology, new facilities, more people stop, process, deport illegal immigrants.    But security start borders, doesn't end there. Millions undocumented immigrants live work here without knowing identity background. need strike workable bargain them. acknowledge breaking immigration laws wrong. pay penalty, abide laws going forward. earn right stay over 6-year period, wait another 5 years legal permanent residents before become citizens.    But exchange accepting those penalties, allow undocumented immigrants come out shadows step path toward full participation society. fact, support bill provide earned path citizenship undocumented population--not humanitarian reasons; people, having broken law, best motives, try provide better life children grandchildren; practical way handle population within borders right now.    To keep having go through difficult process again future, replace flow undocumented immigrants coming work here new flow guestworkers. Illegal immigration bad illegal immigrants bad workers against compete.    Replacing flood illegals regulated stream legal immigrants enter United States background checks provided labor rights enhance security, raise wages, improve working conditions Americans.    But fully appreciate create new guestworker program without making close impossible illegal workers find employment. need new guestworkers plus future undocumented immigrants. need guestworkers instead undocumented immigrants.    Toward end, American employers need take responsibility. illegal immigrants lured here promise job, receive unconscionably low wages. interest cheap labor, unscrupulous employers look way employees provide fraudulent U.S. citizenship documents. actually call place orders undocumented workers don't want pay minimum wages American workers surrounding communities. acts hurt both American workers immigrants whose sole aim work hard ahead. need simple, foolproof, mandatory mechanism employers check legal status new hires. Such mechanism Judiciary Committee bill.    And before guestworker hired, job made available Americans decent wage benefits. Employers need show Americans take jobs. willing take faith jobs Americans take. showing. guestworker program succeed, properly calibrated make certain jobs filled Americans, guestworkers provide particular skills can't find country.    I know dealing undocumented population difficult, practical political reasons. simply claim dealt problems illegal immigration ignore illegal resident population pretend leave voluntarily. proposed ideas Congress provide temporary legal status call deportation, fail answer government deport 11 million people. don't know done. don't know line up buses trains airplanes send 11 million people back countries origin. don't know expect voluntarily leave having taken risk coming country without proper documentation.    I don't know many police officers country go along bill came out House, bill would, enacted, charge undocumented immigrants felonies, arrest priests providing meals hungry immigrants, people running shelters women subject domestic abuse. imagine serious making illegal immigrants felons, going those aid such persons.    That approach serious. symbolism, demagoguery. important going deal problem, deal practical, commonsense way. temporary legal status granted policy immigrants never good enough become Americans, policy makes little sense.    I believe successful, comprehensive immigration reform achieved building work Judiciary Committee. Judiciary Committee bill combines strongest elements Senator Hagel's border security proposals realistic workplace earned-citizenship program proposed Senators McCain Kennedy.    Mr. President, come floor over next week offer amendments own, support amendments colleagues offer. come floor argue against amendments contradict tradition nation immigrants nation laws.    As FDR reminded Nation 50th anniversary dedication Statue Liberty, those landed Ellis Island ``were men women supreme courage strike    out themselves, abandon language relatives, start bottom without influence, without money, without knowledge life very young civilization.''    It behooves remember single immigrant came United States through Ellis Island proper documentation. one grandparents great-grandparents necessarily qualified legal immigration. came here search dream, search hope.

Mr. President, talking immigration challenge facing country. one needs faced dealt with, believe possible achieve comprehensive reform. Unfortunately, legislation before today job. consistent heard Alabama voters telling voters over country immigration legislation.    Let make couple points issue.    There two aspects, guess one say. One aspect those people here illegally treated, ones allowed stay ones allowed stay under conditions.    Those very important matters discuss depth and, frankly, done that, effective way. passed portion immigration bill last Monday 3 hours debate, 6 o'clock, bill floor next day Wednesday, actually passed out committee printed Wednesday night. very little serious discussion bill.    It tremendous problem. dealing 1.1 million people entering [Page: S2724] country illegally being arrested each year Border Patrol agency--1.1 million. huge. system, heard Democratic leader earlier today, lawless chaos. going deal comprehensively human situation facing, ought deal challenges legal system try make borders lawful place instead chaos?    First, want say, this. difficult. simply take down ``come in'' sign there, ``come illegally sooner later going make legal'' sign. need create enforcement border create good enforcement workplace, reach tipping point people find better biometric card come right border crossing go present go right in. go right back home want go home. work. made work.    Let tell challenges existence think haven't met those challenges. 1.1 million arrests. think possible serious send clear message world come lawfully, see lot fewer people attempt come illegally. matter fact, confident that.    Another problem those ``other Mexicans.'' referred now consistently catch-and-release policy. deal: apprehend someone Mexican, easily taken back border, maybe day within day two. someone caught coming border Brazil islands China someplace that? much more difficult problem. done good job confronting it, happened is, those people arrested border many times turn themselves agents. take 100 miles further inside border, released bail asked come back hearing explain here illegally. Well, don't come back. fact, one district, one area, 95 percent people released being caught didn't show up hearing.    Does make mockery law? even putting names National Crime Information Center--they haven't been. are, still small number getting system apprehended somewhere country, picked up. skip DUI charge, put name NCIC, stopped Maryland Virginia New York California, hit wanted DUI somewhere. doing that. indicates lack interest seeing law works. fixed. going fix it, hasn't fixed.    In appellate process--we hearing morning--and Senator Specter language bill before today take good step toward fixing problem appeals. committee, however, somebody offered amendment take out, taken out. problem: 4 years, 600-percent increase number appeals immigration cases. result, created large backlog. backlog resulted unbelievable situation takes 27 months now decision. 600-percent increase 27 months before appeal decision out courts. getting transcript ready; delays court system. proposal fix that. obviously fixed going transition chaotic system lawful system.
