                    <p>In 2005, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and 
Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) was signed into law. In part, it added a
 new term to the Bankruptcy Code ("Code"), "debt relief agency," and 
both restricted and proscribed actions by those groups falling under the
 definition. Subsequently, a Minnesota bankruptcy law firm sought a 
declaratory judgment against the United States, arguing that the BAPCPA 
did not apply to attorneys and law firms, and was unconstitutional as it
 applied to attorneys. The federal district court agreed and issued an 
order declaring that attorneys in the District of Minnesota were 
excluded from the Code's definition of "debt relief agency" and that the
 challenged provisions of the Code were unconstitutional as they applied
 to attorneys in the District of Minnesota.</p>
<p>On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit held that 
attorneys who provide "bankruptcy assistance" were included within the 
BAPCPA's definition of "debt relief agency." However, it also held that 
BAPCPA provisions that prohibited a debt relief agency from advising 
clients to incur debt in contemplation of bankruptcy was overbroad, and 
thus unconstitutional.</p>

                    <p>1) Did the Eight Circuit's interpretation of attorneys as "debt relief agencies" contradict the plain meaning of the BAPCPA?</p>
<p>2) Does the BAPCA constitute a broad, content-based restriction on 
attorney- client communications that is not adequately tailored to 
constrain only speech the government has a substantial interest in 
restricting; and, thus violates the First Amendment?</p>
<p>3) Does the BAPCPA, as applied to attorneys, restrict commercial 
speech by requiring mandatory disclosures in advertisements, and thus 
violate First Amendment free speech rights?</p>

                    <p>No. No. No. With Justice Sonia Sotamayor writing 
for the majority, the Supreme Court held that attorneys who provide 
bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt relief agencies under
 the BAPCPA. The Court further held that § 526(a)(4) of the BAPCPA is 
not an overly broad, content based restriction on attorney-client 
communications. Rather, the Court reasoned that it merely prohibits a 
debt relief agency only from advising a debtor to incur more debt 
because the debtor is filing for bankruptcy. Lastly, the Court held that
 § 528's disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Mr. Milavetz. 
The Court reasoned that the disclosure requirements do not act as an 
affirmative limitation on speech and are reasonably related to the 
government's interest in preventing consumer deception.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a separate opinion, concurring in part 
and concurring in the judgment. He disagreed with the majority's use of 
the BAPCPA's legislative history arguing that "legislative history is 
irrelevant when the statutory text is clear." Justice Clarence Thomas 
also concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. He noted his 
skepticism with <em>Zauderer</em> and its progeny, cases at the heart of
 the majority's reasoning. Justice Thomas wondered whether these 
precedents provide sufficient First Amendment protection against 
government-mandated disclosure requirements.</p>

<p>ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR. ON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &amp; MILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: We will hear argument first this 
morning in Case 08-1119, Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz v. United 
States and United States v. Milavetz.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</p>
<p>Section 526(a)(4) is unconstitutional because it proscribes truthful 
information about entirely lawful activity, it whipsaws the attorneys 
who are trying to apply it, it creates an impossible situation for them,
 and it harms the client.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: If it were confined to unlawful activity and
 narrowly drawn, do you concede that such a statute would be 
constitutional?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but the real challenge is to actually do that narrowing--</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: You say "perhaps".</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>Can Congress by an appropriately, an appropriately drawn narrow 
statute, prohibit attorneys from advising, A, criminal conduct in 
reference to a bankruptcy; or, B, civil conduct -- conduct that is 
improper under the civil code because it's a fraud on creditors?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes, Justice Kennedy, if it were narrowly drawn to apply to criminal activity or fraudulent activity, yes.</p>
<p>Those terms have well-established meanings.</p>
<p>We know how to apply them.</p>
<p>This statute, of course, does not do that.</p>
<p>Now, the government does not defend the statute as written.</p>
<p>The government seeks to rewrite it, but the manner in which the 
government seeks to rewrite the statute really doesn't work under the 
statutory terms.</p>
<p>We do not have that guidance.</p>
<p>The government in its brief proposes three different formulations of how it might be narrowed.</p>
<p>None of those work, even if we -- we were to accept any of those formulations.</p>
<p>We don't know what "abusive conduct" means.</p>
<p>The government simply would trade a First Amendment problem for a vagueness problem.</p>
<p>We do not have--</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But there's already in the statute an --
 a required attestation from the lawyer who signs a bankruptcy petition 
that the petition does not constitute an abuse.</p>
<p>This is 707(b).</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes, Justice Ginsburg.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: And the words are something like "does not constitute an abuse".</p>
<p>So apparently it has meaning there.</p>
<p>Why doesn't -- why don't we say, well, whatever it means in 707(b), it also means in 5, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Two reasons, Justice Ginsburg.</p>
<p>First, the 707(b) abuse standard is a completely different context.</p>
<p>It involves gatekeeping to the access to bankruptcy relief.</p>
<p>The second reason is that Congress -- there is no indication 
whatsoever, in the legislative history or elsewhere, that Congress 
intended to import the abuse standard under Section 707 into the 
526(a)(4) context.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: Well, again in the hypothetical context, 
could Congress enforce by a statute what it requires in the attestation 
clause?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: No, Justice Kennedy, because the abuse standard is too 
nebulous to satisfy, I think, scrutiny under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: So you think the attestation clause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: It can be the basis for sanctioning an attorney--</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: I mean, how can that be if it's too vague.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Well, I think, Your Honor, that the gateway to the 
bankruptcy procedures or basically provisions, like section 707 or in 
the Chapter 11 context, basically are equitable inquiry that looks into 
the totality of the circumstances, whether what the lawyer has done or 
what the debtor has done -- and really it looks to what the debtor has 
done -- would be such that it would deny access to bankruptcy relief.</p>
<p>Has the debtor engaged in inequitable conduct, engaged in inequitable
 conduct in some way that would basically shut the door to bankruptcy 
relief?</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: The attestation clause is designed to ensure
 that the attorney has performed in an ethical and proper way, I take 
it.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: In a sense.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: Isn't that one of its purposes?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: I think it goes more towards the attorney checking the 
information that the debtor has basically provided in the petition and 
elsewhere to make sure that the information that's provided is accurate 
and that the bankruptcy petition is not being proposed in essence for an
 abusive purpose.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: I won't take up too much more of your 
argument, but it just seems to me odd that you can enforce an 
attestation clause, but not a statute that does the same thing.</p>
<p>I don't understand the principle for that.</p>
<p>You say it's a gateway and it's designed to facilitate the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>Well, the government could say the same thing about its statute.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Except, I think, Your Honor, that whereas for the 
purposes of getting into bankruptcy or staying in bankruptcy is one 
standard that courts apply basically on an equitable basis, that 
analysis -- what Congress did there, it didn't have in mind First 
Amendment concerns.</p>
<p>It didn't have in mind trying to narrowly tailor the statutory regime
 so that lawyers basically can understand what they are doing in a way 
and communicate it to their client.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: Well, Congress often forgets about the First Amendment, but lawyers don't.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: That's true, Your Honor, and that's the heart of the problem here.</p>
<p>The problem here is that when Congress basically -- first of all, Congress didn't import the 707(b) standard into 526(a)(4)--</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: What are the words in 707(b)?</p>
<p>I mean, they are both in the statute.</p>
<p>What the lawyer has to attest to is required by statute.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --That is true, Justice Ginsburg.</p>
<p>But there is no evidence that Congress, in the legislative history or
 otherwise, that Congress intended the 707{b} standard to be the 
standard that governs what the lawyer can tell the client under section 
526 (a)(4)--</p>
<p>Justice John Paul Stevens: But isn't there another problem?</p>
<p>Even if Congress didn't think of the problem, don't we have the duty 
to construe the statute to avoid constitutional problems if there is any
 reasonable basis for doing so?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes, Justice Stevens, but this statute is not reasonable susceptible to the government's interpretation.</p>
<p>Justice John Paul Stevens: That is an entirely different argument from the fact that Congress didn't think of this problem.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: That's correct, Justice Stevens.</p>
<p>But the problem here is that what the government has tried to do is 
tease out a standard from the 526(a)(4), and the problem is that -- two 
problems: One, the "in contemplation of" language only modifies half the
 statute, so the "or pay the attorney" prong is not even addressed by 
the government's narrowing construction.</p>
<p>They kind of ignore that.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the "in contemplation of" language cannot bear the weight the government would have it bear--</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: What do you think that means?</p>
<p>What do you think "in contemplation of bankruptcy" means?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --I think it means what the Court said it meant in the 
Pender case interpreting section 60(d) of the former Bankruptcy Act of 
1898.</p>
<p>That is, whether bankruptcy is likely or imminent; in contemplation 
of bankruptcy, taking some action where a bankruptcy case is imminent or
 likely.</p>
<p>Now, it appears--</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: Well, let's say someone goes to the lawyer and 
they discuss the person's debt situation and the decision is made that a
 bankruptcy petition is going to be filed at some future date.</p>
<p>And you think that everything that that person does after that point is done in contemplation of bankruptcy?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Not necessarily, Justice Alito.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: Then, why not?</p>
<p>The person drives home in contemplation of bankruptcy, the person has lunch in contemplation of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Well, I think that would--</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: Doesn't it mean -- "in contemplation of 
bankruptcy" means because of the expectation of filing a bankruptcy 
petition later?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --I think that that would assume that the filing of the
 bankruptcy petition looms entirely in the consciousness of the debtor 
when the debtor does everything.</p>
<p>But I do -- I do think that the 329, is a neutral phrase.</p>
<p>"In contemplation of" means nothing more than is the bankruptcy filing likely?</p>
<p>It doesn't have any nefarious, it doesn't have any abusive context to it at all.</p>
<p>For example, section 329--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: Wait.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean is it likely.</p>
<p>"In contemplation of" means that the reason you are doing this is the contemplated bankruptcy.</p>
<p>You don't see any causal connection in that phrase?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --I do see a causal connection, but there is no element
 of doing something improper in the language "in contemplation of".</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: Well, that's true.</p>
<p>That may be true enough.</p>
<p>But -- but the act must be taken because you are about to file a bankruptcy petition.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Yes, Justice Scalia.</p>
<p>But the government relies and hinges its argument on the abusive connotation to the "in contemplation of".</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: That's a different question.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: That doesn't exist.</p>
<p>So what the government is trying to do is rewrite the statute by 
importing meaning into a phrase that has never been there and doesn't 
exist there.</p>
<p>Every time we see the "in contemplation of" phrase appearing either 
under the current law or under a prior law, if there was some element of
 abuse coupled with it that was separately stated, and of course there 
is no separate statement here.</p>
<p>Now, again I go back to the fact that this -- the practical effect of
 section 526(a)(4) is to make an impossible situation for attorneys.</p>
<p>We have two regimes: One under applicable normal ethical State bar 
rules which say you have to give unfettered candid advice to your 
client; and this provision which gives you must give truncated advice; 
there are thing you cannot say.</p>
<p>But whether you are in one regime or another depends upon whether the debtor is--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Is there a -- is there a difference between unethical and illegal advice?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --I think--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: As an attorney can you under -- give unethical advice?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes, I think so, Justice Sotomayor--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Under the State rules you can give unethical advice as a lawyer?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --You cannot, no.</p>
<p>That is proscribed by the State rules.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: So if you are not permitted to do so, what in the First Amendment would otherwise give you that right?</p>
<p>I mean, this is a commercial transaction of sorts.</p>
<p>It's a fiduciary duty, but it's a commercial transaction.</p>
<p>They are coming to you and they are paying you for certain advice, so
 why would the person then protect your right to give unethical advice.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: It wouldn't protect your right to give unethical advice.</p>
<p>The problem is that the statute sweeps within it's scope perfectly truthful advice about lawful activity.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: We are assuming that it's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive conduct.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Correct.</p>
<p>But just as--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Assuming that is read into the statute or is
 viewed as part of "in contemplation of bankruptcy", what in the First 
Amendment would make that be?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --The First Amendment would not protect unethical advice.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that the term "abusive" which the government 
wants to interlineate into the statute is itself inherently vague, 
unlike "fraudulent conduct"--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Which doesn't explain why.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Because "abusive", it's like "seditious utterances".</p>
<p>It's not something which a normal person who just looks at it would be able to understand what it means.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: You don't understand what it means as a lawyer?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: I have some ideas about what means.</p>
<p>But because of the onerous sanctions that section 526(c) imposes, if 
I'm wrong I can be basically subject to a whole panoply of remedies, 
some very serious remedies and very serious punishments for making a 
mistake.</p>
<p>And that's one of the problems under the First Amendment--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: What if you leave "abusive" out.</p>
<p>Let's accept your point that "abusive" is not there and the government is reading in out of nowhere.</p>
<p>What's -- what's the matter with the statute then?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --I'll give you--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: It just prohibits giving advice in contemplation of bankruptcy that somebody incur more debt.</p>
<p>What's unlawful about that?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Well, I'll give you -- I'll give you a perfect example.</p>
<p>Suppose the debtor's problem is that he lives in a house that is too expensive for him.</p>
<p>He comes to the lawyer: I'm in financial distress.</p>
<p>The lawyer suggests -- the lawyer would logically suggest: Why don't you sell your house and rent an apartment?</p>
<p>But the signing of the lease is incurring debt, the lease obligation.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: But that's not in contemplation of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: It would be, Justice Scalia, if the debtor comes to you
 in financial distress, is thinking about filing for bankruptcy, and 
wants the advice in that context.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: If the only reason the lawyer gives the 
advice is because he knows that this -- that this debtor is planning to 
file bankruptcy, he says, if you are going to file bankruptcy, you 
better sell the house and move to an apartment, then it's no good.</p>
<p>Now, it may be a stupid law, but I don't see why it's -- why it's unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Because it's perfectly legitimate advice about perfectly lawful activity--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: So it's a stupid law.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Well, what happens is that basically it interferes 
with the lawyer's ability through speech to communicate full and candid 
advice to the client.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: Exactly.</p>
<p>And that's why it's a stupid law.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: And ultimately under--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: Now, where is the prohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution?</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Justice Scalia, I think the problem here is that this
 stupid law does not pass either strict scrutiny and it is substantially
 overbroad.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: How much of your case depends upon the
 difficulty of defining what -- if you accept the idea that "in 
contemplation of" means abusive or fraudulent, how much of your case 
depends upon the proposition that it's just hard to tell, that it's -- 
it's a multifactored inquiry and that the lawyer sort of has to stop and
 think at every turn: Well, could this be construed as recommending 
abuse, or is this just construed as telling clients what they can and 
can't do?</p>
<p>And in some areas it's a gray area, and what should you do when it's a gray area?</p>
<p>Is that -- does your case depend upon that, which is, I guess, just 
an issue with the limiting construction proposed by the Solicitor 
General?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: It doesn't turn on that, but that demonstrates the chilling effect.</p>
<p>The effect of the statute has been to drive conscientious bankruptcy counsel from the practice.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it's not just difficult to apply; it's often impossible to apply.</p>
<p>The whole statute turns on whether the debtor, the client or 
prospective client, is an assisted person, which depends on the relative
 wealth of the client, which is something very, very difficult to 
determine at any particular given point in time.</p>
<p>So the lawyer doesn't know: Am I restricted in my speech under 
526(a)(4) because that applies or does 526(a)(4) not apply at all 
because I am not dealing with an assisted person, such that I am under 
normal State bar rules which requires me to give unfettered advice?</p>
<p>And since that is impossible to know without detailed, careful 
analysis of the relative wealth of the client, the statute is basically 
impossible to apply--</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: Well, if we assume a proper limited 
construction -- I know you disagree with that, but if we assume that we 
can limit the statute properly so that it applies just to unethical 
conduct, then you can't give that advice to anybody, and the fact that 
assisted persons is a subclass of that is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --That would be true, Justice Kennedy, if in fact we 
could tease out from the abusive conduct, if people could actually 
understand what "abusive" meant.</p>
<p>Does that proscribe -- what does it proscribe?</p>
<p>It's too vague.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: Yes, but that doesn't go to your other point
 that there's a problem in determining the class of persons.</p>
<p>If it's unethical, you can't give it to anybody.</p>
<p>And the fact that the class of persons is difficult to understand is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Yes, Justice Kennedy, but that assumes that we can do 
the narrowing construction, I think as Your Honor points out.</p>
<p>And that, again, is a fundamental problem because the standard the 
government would like to impose or interlineate in the statute is 
entirely vague.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: You want to -- I mean, your first point 
is -- and we never get to that question because lawyers shouldn't be 
under this act at all.</p>
<p>They shouldn't be labelled debt relief agencies.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.</p>
<p>Our point on the statutory construction piece is that the statute is 
ambiguous and that to avoid the constitutional questions -- actually, 
avoid two constitutional questions here, the constitutional question 
under 526(a)(4) and then a separate constitutional question under 
528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B)--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: It's only lawyers who are protected against vague criminal statutes?</p>
<p>It's okay for the rest of the world to have to -- cope with this -- vagueness, but once you take lawyers out of it it's okay?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Certainly not, Justice Scalia, which is why--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: So then -- so then there is no reason in 
particular to take lawyers out of it just to make it constitutional.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Well, our argument there, Justice Scalia, is that the statute does not unambiguously embrace attorneys.</p>
<p>101(12)(a) where you think it would be, because wherever Congress has
 otherwise intended to regulate attorneys in connection with bankruptcy 
practice, it has used the word "attorney" specifically.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: That's fine.</p>
<p>If you -- if you are letting that argument stand on its own, that's a fine argument.</p>
<p>But don't -- don't bring in the fact that, well then, moreover, if 
it's applied to attorneys, it's unconstitutional, because if it's 
applied to anybody it's unconstitutional according to your argument.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: That is also true, Justice Scalia, because we do make a substantial overbreadth argument.</p>
<p>The statute is substantially overbroad.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Now, but when you say it isn't referred to, it seems to me to be referred to.</p>
<p>It says</p>
<p>"The term "debt relief agency" means-- "</p>
<p>"any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person. "</p>
<p>And the term "bankruptcy assistance" is defined to include</p>
<p>"appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing 
legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding. "</p>
<p>Doesn't a lawyer provide legal representation?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: A lawyer does, Justice Breyer.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: All right.</p>
<p>So doesn't the term "provide legal representation" include a lawyer?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: The problem, Justice Breyer, is that I think when Your 
Honor was quoting from section 101(4A), Your Honor took out a whole lot 
of information that goes between the word "bankruptcy assistance" and 
"legal representation".</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Yes; they include other people besides lawyers.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Not only that, but I think that that language is inherently ambiguous.</p>
<p>What is Congress getting at there?</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I don't know.</p>
<p>What is it getting at with</p>
<p>"providing legal representation with respect to a case? "</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: That would seem to be with respect to lawyers.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: It would seem to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: But it's precluded -- it's preceded by language,</p>
<p>"any goods or services sold or otherwise provided to an assisted 
person with the express or implied purpose of providing information, et 
cetera, about legal representation. "</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Yeah.</p>
<p>Those are other people who are covered.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Well, not just other people, but what it looks like, is
 it looks like what Congress was getting at was people who provide 
things like what attorneys provide.</p>
<p>Now, there are a whole host of problems with including attorneys within the definition of "debt relief agency".</p>
<p>I mean, it's counter -- it's contrary to the purpose of what Congress seemed to be getting at.</p>
<p>It leads to anomalous results.</p>
<p>It does various things--</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: How is it any different from including 
lawyers within the category "debt collectors", which lawyers objected to
 in this Court unsuccessfully?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes, Justice Ginsburg.</p>
<p>But there it was interesting.</p>
<p>There, there -- in the Heintz case, that was a situation where 
lawyers had been expressly excluded from the statutory regime, then 
Congress repealed the exclusion, so a clear signal to include attorneys.</p>
<p>Here, we have the opposite.</p>
<p>We have a very ambiguous legislative history, where in the initial 
version of this legislation the House report accompanying it said 
lawyers were included and the language was "debt relief counseling 
agency".</p>
<p>Then Congress amended the statute -- Congress amended the proposed 
legislation in 1999, and thereafter in the 2001, 2003, and 2005 House 
reports deleted all reference to attorneys -- a very, very strange tale,
 which seems to signal exactly the opposite of the Heintz case.</p>
<p>So we have a very ambiguous legislative history that seems to give us a contrary signal.</p>
<p>That in part is part of the ambiguity behind this statute, which I 
think is one of the reasons why it's perfectly -- the statute is readily
 susceptible to an interpretation--</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I thought that in the legislative 
history there were examples of lawyers overreaching, that the conduct 
that Congress was aiming at was engaged in by lawyers, as well as 
others.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --There are some references in the legislative history to that, Justice Ginsburg.</p>
<p>There are a few scattered references in the legislative history.</p>
<p>But again, the legislative history is very ambiguous.</p>
<p>It seems to go in lots of different directions.</p>
<p>Now, recall, Justice Ginsburg--</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: I have heard of referring to legislative history when the statute is ambiguous.</p>
<p>I haven't heard of referring to legislative history to make the statute ambiguous.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes, Justice Kennedy.</p>
<p>I think the statute is ambiguous for a whole host of reasons, and the
 legislative history does not clear up the ambiguity; it actually 
deepens it.</p>
<p>So the legislative history reinforces the other indicators, the textual indicators, of in fact ambiguity here.</p>
<p>But I think -- I think it is also important to underscore not only 
would the constitutional avoidance, application of that canon here, by 
excluding attorneys from debt relief agencies solve the problem under 
section 526(a)(4), but also under section 528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B).</p>
<p>528--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Before you go on on 528, could you clarify for me: What is your challenge to 528?</p>
<p>Is it a normal--</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --528, Justice Sotomayor?</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: --528.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Is it a normal facial invalidity?</p>
<p>Is it an overbreadth invalidity?</p>
<p>Is it an as-applied challenge?</p>
<p>What exactly are you claiming with respect to that--</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Does Your Honor mean 526 or 528?</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: --528.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: 528.</p>
<p>528, the disclosures in the advertising provision?</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Yes.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: We are challenging that on as-applied it violates the Constitution--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Can you tell me how you have an as-applied challenge when I don't even know what ad is at issue?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p>I think it's the same as the Cincinnati case, where in fact there was
 no obligation that the handbills that were being distributed were any 
way deceptive or misleading.</p>
<p>That's the same situation here.</p>
<p>The district court--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: I -- I have scoured the record for a handbill, meaning -- an advertisement--</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: --by you that I could look at and say, you know, I'm looking at it and it's not misleading.</p>
<p>So where is it in the record?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: The ads are not in the record.</p>
<p>But, as the district court found, there is no evidence suggesting 
that bankruptcy assistance advertisements that -- that Petitioners' 
bankruptcy advertisements are deceptive in any regard.</p>
<p>The government never alleged that Petitioners engaged in any deceptive advertising.</p>
<p>That's--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: I -- I truly have never heard of an 
as-applied challenge when we don't know what it is being applied to.</p>
<p>But putting that aside, so you have an as-applied challenge; do you have a facial challenge or an overbreadth challenge?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --With respect to the advertisements with the commercial speech?</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Yes, the 528.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: No, it's not a -- it's not a facial challenge; it's an as-applied challenge.</p>
<p>But here -- here's the point on the evidentiary point.</p>
<p>The government never sought to introduce that evidence because it's not at issue.</p>
<p>There is no dispute that Petitioners' advertisement is not -- is--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Did the government bring this lawsuit below?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --We brought this lawsuit as a declaratory judgment action.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: So what, were they supposed to scour your advertisements to find the violation?</p>
<p>Was that it?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: No, unless there was an allegation that in some way Petitioners' advertisements were misleading.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>It's not a disputed question.</p>
<p>It's not a disputed factual question.</p>
<p>There is no dispute, and the district court basically found that 
there is no allegation that Petitioners' advertising is deceptive or 
untruthful in any way.</p>
<p>So Petitioners' advertising is not of the kind that Congress was trying to target.</p>
<p>Now, the problem and the burden that 528 imposes is that it requires 
counterfactual, misleading statements that interfere with legitimate 
advertising messages.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>The statute is not narrowly tailored under Central Hudson to address 
the "make debts disappear" problem the government identifies as 
animating this particular statute.</p>
<p>Let me give a simple illustration to sort of illustrate my point.</p>
<p>Suppose I sell bread and the government required me to say -- 
disclose: I am a bread supply agency; I sell products that contain 
wheat.</p>
<p>Well, what if the bread I sell does not contain wheat, it's wheat-free?</p>
<p>Forcing me to make that statement is counterfactual and misleading.</p>
<p>That's what this statute does.</p>
<p>If I also sell milk, it requires me to make the statement: I am the bread relief -- the bread supply agency--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Could I ask you something?</p>
<p>When you are an attorney advertising as an attorney who gives advice 
on bankruptcy, why aren't you a debt release -- relief advisor?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --The problem, Justice Sotomayor, is that that statement inherently is misleading.</p>
<p>When lawyers -- when clients look for lawyers, bankruptcy lawyers or 
just lawyers in general, they don't want to see someone called a debt 
relief agency.</p>
<p>It conveys no meaningful information.</p>
<p>In fact, it's misleading.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: They don't want to be -- lawyers don't 
want to be called debt collectors either, and in this, the Fair Debt 
Collection Act, it says that -- that communication must say the 
communication is from a debt collector, except that formal pleadings are
 not -- you don't have to identify.</p>
<p>It seems to me that that -- that would be a harder thing for a lawyer
 to do, to identify herself in an advertisement as, I am a debt 
collector, than I am a debt relief agency.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Yes, but the debt collection statute doesn't require that in advertising.</p>
<p>It requires that in letters and things like that that go to other 
parties where you are actually trying to help collect the debt.</p>
<p>So it's a communication that the lawyer is making, for example, and a disclosure that's required.</p>
<p>Here putting in your advertising "I'm a debt collection agency" conveys no meaningful information to the public.</p>
<p>In fact, it is misleading.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: Well, A, I suppose you don't have to 
advertise; or B, if you do, you can say in your bread hypo: Under the 
Federal law we have bread, but our bread is -- I don't know -- 
gluten-free or whatever.</p>
<p>You can use--</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Yes, Justice Kennedy.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy: --You can always add -- add in order to make it non-misleading.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: But that would require a statement in our advertising 
that is actually -- to make it fundamentally dissimilar to the statement
 that's being actually imposed on us, we have to say -- we have to put 
in the advertising something like "This product contains wheat".</p>
<p>Then we also have to say, but my product doesn't.</p>
<p>So, for the consumer who is looking at the information, it's inherently misleading because the two conflict--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: This is a proposal for a commercial transaction, right?</p>
<p>You are trying to get a consumer to hire you.</p>
<p>And the First Amendment standards for proposals for commercial 
transactions have always been more -- more lenient than other First 
Amendment contexts.</p>
<p>We -- we -- we regulate the content of advertising all the time.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Yes, Justice Scalia, but this statute is odd because 
it requires counterfactual information, it's not narrowly drawn to 
address the problem the government identifies.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: I don't know--</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: If a law firm -- if a law firm provides 
representation for debtors in bankruptcy, what is misleading about 
requiring them to say: We help people file for bankruptcy relief under 
the Bankruptcy Code?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Because the scope of 528(b)(2)(B) is so broad.</p>
<p>If I am advertising mortgage foreclosure services having nothing to 
do with bankruptcy, I still must make this counterfactual statement.</p>
<p>528 -- for example, in my bread hypothetical, if I am also selling 
milk, and the government says when I am selling milk through my milk 
advertisement I have to say I am a bread supply agency, I sell products 
that contain wheat, that is commpletelt misleading and irrelevant to the
 milk advertisement.</p>
<p>But this statute does the same thing.</p>
<p>If I am advertising eviction protection services having nothing to do
 with bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure services representation having 
nothing to do with the bankruptcy, I have to make these counterfactual 
statements that are inherently misleading.</p>
<p>If there are no questions at the moment, I would like to reserve my time.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Thank you, Mr. Brunstad.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay.</p>
<p>ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</p>
<p>I would like to begin with the threshold statutory question if I may.</p>
<p>I have only a few points on that.</p>
<p>A debt relief agency is any person who provides specified services to specified clients for pay.</p>
<p>An attorney is a person, a defined term under the Bankruptcy Code, 
and the Petitioners have affirmatively alleged in their complaint that 
they provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons.</p>
<p>We think that is all that is required to determine that they are debt relief agencies under the statute.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: What about the provision that says the directors, employees, are not included?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: As I understand Petitioners' argument about that provision, 
it is that Congress would surely have made an exception for partners as 
well had it intended to include attorneys.</p>
<p>We think that that is a multi-step chain of reasoning that breaks down at each step.</p>
<p>Congress made an exception from the definition of "debt relief 
agencies" for officers and employees of the business that is itself a 
debt relief agency.</p>
<p>Partnerships, of course, have employees as well, and a 
run-of-the-mill employee of a partnership who doesn't provided the 
bankruptcy assistance services himself is not himself a debt relief 
agency--</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: What about an associate?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --I think, Justice Ginsburg, an associate is an employee, so
 if the associate in a law firm provides -- doesn't provide the 
bankruptcy assistance herself, then she is not a debt relief agency.</p>
<p>It's the -- because any person is defined under the Bankruptcy Code to include individual partnership or corporation.</p>
<p>That is Section 101(41).</p>
<p>It's the law firm that provides the services, is a person who provides the services and therefore a debt relief agency.</p>
<p>I suppose an individual who provides the services himself or herself might be an agency, a debt relief agency, as well.</p>
<p>But we don't think that the absence of a specific exception for 
partners of a partnership tells us anything that would derogate from the
 plain meaning of the defined terms in the statute.</p>
<p>The fact that partners are liable for actions of the partnership is a commonplace of partnership law.</p>
<p>And it's also not the case that all attorneys practice in partnerships.</p>
<p>The Petitioner law firm is a professional corporation and one of the 
individual Petitioners is a director of that -- of that professional 
corporation.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: What he -- what I think his argument is, 
as I understand it, is if you look at the definition of "bankruptcy 
assistance", you will see there are seven different things that a person
 could do and fall within that definition.</p>
<p>And all of those seven things are probably provided by the kinds of 
agencies you see advertised on television, which say: We will help you 
with your debts.</p>
<p>And they probably aren't lawyers.</p>
<p>And, so, if you look at the six of the seven things, it's clear that all of those are provided by those television companies.</p>
<p>And the seventh is simply added in, namely the providing legal 
representation, to be a catch-all to be sure that if one of those 
companies actually does something that is legal representation, even 
though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too.</p>
<p>So he is saying, read the whole paragraph and then you will see they 
are after the companies that appear on television and they're not after 
lawyers.</p>
<p>And then he says that's the history of the bill, and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, that's the argument, and so it isn't -- can't quite be brushed off as quickly, I think, as you did.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: Well, I -- I am happy to respond to it in further detail.</p>
<p>I think that the -- first, the reference to appearing in a case or 
proceeding on behalf of another, that can only refer to lawyers.</p>
<p>Even if as you--</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Why?</p>
<p>I mean, there could not only be lawyers.</p>
<p>I mean, there are numerous proceedings where your brother, your mother, your cousin, your friend appears for you.</p>
<p>They say: Bring a friend, bring one of us.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>We will charge you very little, we will save you money.</p>
<p>I am a lawyer, by the way.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --That's right, Justice Breyer, and I think--</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I have relatives who aren't, and you can bring one of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --But appearing -- appearing in a case or proceeding under 
this title, Your Honor, means entering an appearance in court.</p>
<p>I think that's -- that's the natural reading of that phrase.</p>
<p>And Petitioners have suggested that this is an attempt to catch the unauthorized practice of law.</p>
<p>But certainly neither the plain meaning nor the legislative record 
suggests that people who are not lawyers were actually engaging in 
conduct so brazen as to show up in Federal Bankruptcy Court, enter -- 
file a notice of appearance and purport to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>That is not what this statute is intended to catch.</p>
<p>At any rate, the legislative history I think amply supports our view.</p>
<p>Page 21 of our brief collects a number of citations to the legislative record specifically referring to attorneys.</p>
<p>As for the point Mr. Brunstad made about the change in the drafting history of this bill from 1999.</p>
<p>And in the House report accompanying the 1999 version of the bill, 
which had changed from "debt relief counseling agency" to "debt relief 
agency", the House report said,</p>
<p>"It applies to attorneys, as well as to non-attorneys, such as petition preparers. "</p>
<p>"That is page 120 of House Report 106-123. "</p>
<p>So I think that amply refutes the point about the drafting history.</p>
<p>But in any event, if the Court were to look at legislative history, 
we think that the provisions of the 2005 House report accompanying the 
bill that actually was enacted are the most probative, and we've cited 
two references on page 21 of our brief that we think amply demonstrate 
that attorneys are included.</p>
<p>If the Court has no further questions about the--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: So, if -- if -- if lawyers are debt 
relief agencies, I am curious how your limiting construction works.</p>
<p>If a client comes into a lawyer and says, look, I know we are 
thinking of filing bankruptcy, but I want to go to Tahiti and charge it;
 can I do it?</p>
<p>And the lawyer says: Oh, the law says I can't give you advice in 
contemplation of bankruptcy; the Solicitor General says that means I 
can't give you advice in aid of fraud that would deprive debtors of 
assets they might otherwise get, so I can't tell you.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Has that person violated -- has that lawyer violated the statute?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --I don't think so, Your Honor.</p>
<p>The statute prohibits only advice to incur more debt in contemplation of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Well, the person has asked, can I charge the trip to Tahiti?</p>
<p>And the lawyer, although giving perfectly truthful advice, has 
effectively conveyed to his client that if he does he would be depriving
 debtors of assets they might otherwise get.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: But the lawyer in your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, has 
not advised the client to take the trip; it has not advised the client 
to do that.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: He has communicated to the client that
 if he takes the trip, one, he will have a good time in Tahiti; and two,
 he will be using assets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the
 debtors.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: I suppose that, you know, there might be a fact question 
about whether a particular wink and nod communication between an 
attorney and client were in fact advice to engage in the transaction, 
that's prohibited under the Bankruptcy Code, the fraudulent or abusive 
transaction.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: What if -- what if the lawyer said: I 
can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but here's the 
Solicitor General's brief, read that.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>And a reasonable -- my point is a reasonable person reading the brief
 would say, well, the reason he can't give me advice is because that 
might cause me to do something that would defraud the debtors, so I'm 
going to buy the ticket.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: Well, if -- if that debtor reads our brief, that debtor will
 also see that there are serious consequences for the debtor himself, 
which is precisely why Congress passed this statute providing for relief
 for the debtor against the attorney who provides this unethical or 
abusive advice.</p>
<p>An attorney -- sorry.</p>
<p>A client who incurs additional debt intending to defraud the creditor
 may not be able to obtain a discharge of that debt and indeed may not 
be able to obtain a discharge in bankruptcy at all--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Well, that's one of the things I'm 
concerned about your limiting construction, "intending to defraud the 
debtor".</p>
<p>What if the person takes a trip to Tahiti every November?</p>
<p>They've always done it.</p>
<p>They are not intending to defraud the debtor.</p>
<p>They are just doing what they have always done.</p>
<p>So an attorney that gives that advice, would be -- that would be okay?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the Culver case, a -- a 
disciplinary case that we referred to in our brief, is a good 
illustration of this.</p>
<p>Fraud turns on the defrauder's intent as a -- as a general matter.</p>
<p>And when someone--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: So if -- so if the lawyer said that, I
 can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell 
you that fraud turns on the debtor's intent?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I don't think that that would be advice to incur the additional debt.</p>
<p>And I don't think that the -- that a debtor who read our brief or who
 informed himself with these hints that you're positing the attorney 
giving, I don't think that the debtor would take the step of -- of 
incurring the additional debt, precisely because there are consequences 
for the debtor, and it's -- it's a grave risk.</p>
<p>That's precisely why Congress prohibited -- prohibited this form of--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: No, but the whole point is that the 
attorney could be providing advice that would steer the debtor away from
 doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>And yet the other -- the government would say, oh, no, no, no, no; 
you are trying to tell him it's okay to take the trip to Tahiti.</p>
<p>If he says you can take the trip to Tahiti so long as your intent is 
not to defraud the debtor -- correct advice that could be read as 
telling the debtor not to do anything wrong or could be read as giving 
the debtor a little, as you say, a wink and a nod and saying, you know, 
what do you intend to do?</p>
<p>And he says, oh, I just intend to go on vacation, not to defraud the debtors.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --I think, Your Honor, subject to some kind of situations of
 willful blindness, that the attorney in that situation would not be 
read by any factfinder to have advised a -- to have advised her client 
to incur additional debt in contemplation of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>And it is -- it is that that is the statutory touchstone.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well, let's take some of the examples that were in the amicus brief.</p>
<p>One of them was the debtor is just told by her doctor that she has a 
serious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and she is at the end
 of the line on resources.</p>
<p>She has her trade tools, which she could sell to get some money, but then she won't be able to carry on her business.</p>
<p>And she could also borrow money, but incurring that debt -- since 
she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's incurring the debt knowing 
that she's on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Could the lawyer say, you don't have to sell your -- the lawyer could say: Sell your equipment.</p>
<p>That wouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>But could the lawyer say, incur the debt?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: I think the lawyer under a number of circumstances could say incur the debt.</p>
<p>Precisely--</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well, take this circumstance.</p>
<p>There is no other -- the person is on a brink of bankruptcy, has no resources, can get money by selling assets or by borrowing.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, if I may, Justice Ginsburg, the hypothetical doesn't state how she's going to borrow the money.</p>
<p>So for example, if she has an open home equity line of credit and she
 borrows against that home equity line of credit, it's a secured loan 
that is not going to be discharged in a Chapter 7 proceeding, I think 
that that's unobjectionable under our reading of the statute.</p>
<p>It's not -- it's not abusive, because it's not an abuse of the bankruptcy system--</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Suppose she doesn't have a home equity loan.</p>
<p>Suppose she's a renter?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, the two -- the two scenarios that our view -- that 
in our view are covered by the statute are taking on debt in an attempt 
to abuse the bankruptcy system or to defraud the creditor.</p>
<p>And even -- even someone without -- without a home equity loan, a 
home equity line of credit, can take on additional debt without 
intending to defraud the creditor simply by -- by intending to repay it.</p>
<p>And that is illustrated in the Culver case, in which the attorney had
 advised the client to take on additional debt, to -- indeed, he gave 
her a credit card application and said, get some more cash advances.</p>
<p>And she said: I don't want to take on this additional debt.</p>
<p>And he said: Don't worry, I will represent you in bankruptcy; you won't have to repay a penny of it.</p>
<p>And the Court of Appeals of Maryland explained that that was 
unethical advice under the Rule 1.2(d), the model rule that applies in 
just about every jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: You can come up with your own 
hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your point of view, and Justice
 Ginsburg has been suggesting some that are much more difficult because 
they depend on particular facts.</p>
<p>And under your construction it seems to me that a lawyer trying to 
give correct, legal, ethical advice has got to pause before every 
sentence and think, oh, is this going to be construed in violation of 
subsection (a)(4)?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'm certainly not attempting to fight Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.</p>
<p>I'm attempting to illustrate that -- that the aspect of the statute 
that prohibits advice to defraud creditors, you know, will turn on, 
among other things, whether there is any intent to repay the debt.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: Isn't something in contemplation of bankruptcy 
done only -- isn't something done in contemplation of bankruptcy only if
 it is done because of the anticipation of filing a bankruptcy petition?</p>
<p>So that if -- if a person takes on additional debt in order to obtain
 life-saving treatment, that is not done in contemplation of bankruptcy;
 it's not done because of the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>It's done because there is an emergency that requires immediate expenditures.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: I think that that's right, Justice Alito, that in that 
hypothetical there is no -- the mere -- the mere fact that the 
bankruptcy may be looming, even in the hypothetical, is not the 
animating cause.</p>
<p>And the Court has--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: If indeed "in contemplation of bankruptcy" 
means, as -- as you argue, that it has to be for the purpose of abusing 
the Bankruptcy Code -- right?</p>
<p>If that's true, then aren't all these vagueness arguments irrelevant, because it would be illegal anyway, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: So even without this statute, the lawyer 
would have to worry about -- about whether he's doing something that is 
unlawful.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --The two prongs of -- of our reading of the statute, that's
 right, Justice Scalia, are to abuse the Bankruptcy Code or to -- or to 
defraud creditors.</p>
<p>The fraud of course is illegal--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: But the point is you don't know.</p>
<p>Of course you can't give advice to do something illegal.</p>
<p>But I -- I would think that some of the questions have been suggesting that it's hard to know whether it's illegal.</p>
<p>You yourself say it depends on the debtor's intent.</p>
<p>So if a client came in to me and said, can I do this, and it depends 
on his intent, as a lawyer I would want to say: It depends on why you 
are doing it.</p>
<p>But if -- but that I think could be construed as being -- giving advice in contemplation of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --But precisely because, Mr. Chief Justice, the definition 
of fraud turns on the defendant or the fraudulent actor's intent, that's
 true under present law, under Rule 1.2(d) which prohibits all attorneys
 from counseling their clients to commit fraudulent acts.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: The lawyer runs that risk anyway, whether this statute applies or not.</p>
<p>He has -- he has to decide whether what he is doing is a fraud on creditors.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: Or an abuse of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out in Mr. Brunstad's argument, that 
is something that the attorney already must be familiar with under 
Section 707(b) and must certify in filing any Chapter 7 bankruptcy that 
in -- after the attorney's professional investigation, that the granting
 of relief would not be an abuse of the provisions of the Bankruptcy 
Code.</p>
<p>Attorneys are -- are making that certification every day when they are filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcies--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: This is a regulation of the 
attorney-client relationship to pursue an unrelated substantive 
objective.</p>
<p>You want to ensure that debtors don't do something and you think, 
well, the way -- it's not enough to tell debtors, don't do this.</p>
<p>You're going to say: We are going to regulate what lawyers tell them as a way of pursuing an unrelated objective.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --I don't think it's unrelated, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>
<p>The objective is in many -- in some instances criminal and in other instances it is prohibited by the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>And the reason that--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Well, the objective is criminal; that 
doesn't mean it is not being indirectly enforced by interfering with the
 attorney-client relationship.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, it is certainly--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: --or affecting the attorney-client relationship.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --It is certainly true, Mr. Chief Justice, that the attorney is the sophisticated player here.</p>
<p>It is the attorney who is the repeat player, and it is the attorney who, by being made subject to this statute, is--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Yes, it's a good way to enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice about it.</p>
<p>What if a State thinks that there are too many punitive damage 
awards, that they are out of control, and so it passes a law saying 
lawyers may not tell their clients that they can get -- they can seek 
punitive damages?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, Mr. Chief Justice, seeking punitive damages is not illegal--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Oh, if it's done with the purpose of fraud, it is.</p>
<p>If you think, well, I'm really -- I really wasn't -- it really wasn't
 malicious conduct, I know that, or whatever the standard is for 
punitive damages, then it's illegal, just like here if you incur debt to
 defraud your debtors it's illegal, but if you don't it's not.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, I think that the restriction that you're positing is
 that advice ever to seek punitive damages is -- is going to be--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Oh, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Only if it's -- you know, it says you can't give that advice in contemplation of filing a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, no.</p>
<p>That would, of course, would be outside the bankruptcy context, and 
we are relying in part here on -- both on the avoidance doctrine and on 
the meaning that "in contemplation of bankruptcy" has had for a long 
time.</p>
<p>But -- but to answer your question, I think that, if there is 
actually a tie between -- so that sounds exactly to me like a 
prohibition saying to the lawyer, don't file complaints for punitive 
damages that aren't supported just under the normal Rule 11 standard.</p>
<p>And I don't think that that is an impermissible attempt to--</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: No, no, no.</p>
<p>It's a difference between filing, because there the lawyer signs the -- signs the complaint.</p>
<p>It's giving advice to the client.</p>
<p>And the -- I guess what I would see as the parallel is that it's an objective outside the attorney-client relationship.</p>
<p>It's not like saying, you can't charge more than 50 percent 
contingent fee or -- or whatever -- you know, designed to regulate the 
client -- protect the client.</p>
<p>It's -- it's a totally extraneous objective.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well, here, I don't think -- I don't think it's an extraneous objective.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am misunderstanding how you -- how the Court is meaning extraneous.</p>
<p>The -- here, the advice is the motivating cause in some of these 
instances of the -- of the debtor taking the step that's going to lead 
to actual harm to the debtor.</p>
<p>That's why Congress provided that the remedy for a violation of this 
is either an injunctive action by a government official, the U.S. 
trustee or by the Court or State attorney general, or actual damages 
paid to the debtor who has suffered harm from the unethical or abuse of 
advice given to him or her by the attorney.</p>
<p>So I think that saying that -- that it's extraneous to the 
attorney-client relationship, I think that's not the statute that -- 
that Congress enacted here.</p>
<p>It enacted a statute that protects the client from improper, 
unethical, abusive, or even criminal -- criminally fraudulent advice by 
the attorney.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: One thing that lawyers who render 
services for money want -- is to be sure that they will get paid, and 
one part of this provision, this 526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt 
to pay an attorney for representing the debtor.</p>
<p>So what can a lawyer say safely about the lawyer's getting paid?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: Well, I would like to note, if I may, Justice Ginsburg, that
 we don't think that that is properly part of this challenge.</p>
<p>I will be happy -- I will be happy to answer the question, but the 
court of appeals struck down this statute, and it said, nine times, that
 it was talking about the portion of the statute referring to in 
"contemplation of bankruptcy".</p>
<p>And the "to pay an attorney" provision was not addressed in the 
Petitioner's brief in the court of appeals or in their brief in 
opposition to our cert position, so we don't -- we don't think it's 
properly here -- it hasn't been addressed.</p>
<p>But to -- to answer your question, the statute says not -- and this 
part of the statute is on page 5a of the appendix to our brief --</p>
<p>"to advise an assisted person to incur more debt to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer. "</p>
<p>So advising the client -- you know, that the client ought to pay the 
fee -- you know, here's my bill, my fee is due on day X, that simply 
doesn't come within the terms of the statute.</p>
<p>It's only to incur more debt to pay the attorney.</p>
<p>And the situation that we think Congress is getting at is the 
circumstance where the attorney wants to be paid up-front, again, like 
in the Culver case, the attorney wants his client to take out a cash 
advance from the credit card company, knowing -- and to give that money 
to the attorney to pay his fee, precisely because the debt's going to be
 -- the unsecured debt to the credit card company is going to be 
discharged in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: That's -- that's the clear case.</p>
<p>How about the person comes in, shows the attorney his or her financial state.</p>
<p>There is no money to pay the fee.</p>
<p>The attorney simply gives a bill and says, "I need it by Friday".</p>
<p>No self-respecting person would believe that the individual is going 
to pay that bill without borrowing money from somewhere, if you have 
looked at their financial statement and there is no money to be had.</p>
<p>Would the attorney have violated the statute there?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor, precisely because the 
attorney -- the attorney still hasn't issued the advice to incur more 
debt.</p>
<p>I mean, the client, of course, also has the opportunity -- or the 
option of not paying the fee and carrying it -- carrying it forward into
 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>So, in any event, we don't think that that provision can -- can be 
the basis for a holding that the other provision about in contemplation 
of bankruptcy is substantially overbroad, which is what the court of 
appeals held here.</p>
<p>If I may, unless the Court has further questions on--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Just one.</p>
<p>So, basically, your bottom line is any advice to incur debt to pay an attorney is illegal?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --To incur more debt to pay an attorney, I think -- I think 
that is the import of the statute, and that's because Congress 
recognized that there is an incentive for attorneys to put pressure on 
their clients to -- to favor the attorney as creditor, to, essentially, 
treat the attorney as a creditor in a better position than other 
creditors.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Perhaps I am being -- not quite understanding you.</p>
<p>You are underscoring the more debt, that is going to always be additional, if the advice is to incur it.</p>
<p>So what meaning are you giving to more that I am missing?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: Well, in some of the examples that have come up in the 
briefing in this case -- you know, a refinancing transaction, for 
example -- you know, or a sale -- sale of the house and replacing it 
with a rental.</p>
<p>We don't think that that is more debt.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I don't how this works exactly.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert.</p>
<p>I thought that, when someone goes bankrupt, that one of the things 
you ask the bankruptcy judge for is permission to pay for ongoing 
expenses, and that would include an attorney's fee.</p>
<p>Otherwise, people could never be represented.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: It's true that the court can authorize--</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Well, so why is there some incentive here?</p>
<p>All the attorney has to do is follow ordinary procedure.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Precisely because, Justice Breyer, different standards 
apply to the -- to payments made to the attorney before the bankruptcy 
commences and payments made to the attorney after the bankruptcy 
commences.</p>
<p>It's a -- the standard of scrutiny after the bankruptcy commences is a -- is a bit more searching under Section 330.</p>
<p>If the Court has no further questions on Section 526, I do want to 
address Section 528, the -- the advertising disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>And, there, we think that, as Justice Sotomayor brought out in her 
exchange with Mr. Brunstad, there is no evidence in this case pertaining
 to the particular advertisements that petitioners want to run.</p>
<p>They simply say, on pages 38 and 39 of the joint appendix, that they have advertised, and they wish to continue to advertise.</p>
<p>There is no allegation about their content.</p>
<p>And they sought and were granted summary judgment in the district court on the theory that this statute is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>And so to the extent that it's anything other than a facial 
challenge, it's an as-applied challenge, as applied, essentially, to any
 attorney or, indeed, anyone who wants to run these advertisements.</p>
<p>We think that, as I understand the gravamen of Petitioners' argument,
 is that the two-sentence suggested text is incorrect, that it's -- that
 it's misleading because it's wrong.</p>
<p>And the basis for that is saying that some people who are debt relief
 agencies don't help people file for bankruptcy relief under the 
Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>That is not correct.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: But isn't it misleading for an attorney to say, I'm a -- I'm a debt relief agency?</p>
<p>Nobody is going to know what a debt relief agency is, unless they are familiar with this statute.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: Well--</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: A perspective client looks at that, and they 
say, well, I don't want a debt relief agency, I want a lawyer.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Well--</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito: That's misleading.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Four points on that, Justice Alito.</p>
<p>First, the advertisement can and indeed, I'm sure always will, say that the advertiser is a lawyer.</p>
<p>Nothing forbids the advertisement from saying that.</p>
<p>There is no restriction on what content goes in the ad, only that it include this is disclaimer.</p>
<p>Second, the term "debt relief agency" is a new one.</p>
<p>It was coined by Congress in 2005 precisely because it includes -- it
 includes attorneys; it includes bankruptcy petition preparers.</p>
<p>They had to -- you know, they had to come up with an amalgamated term that includes them both.</p>
<p>The fact that it's a new term -- it came freighted with no -- no 
preceding -- no baggage from its preceding history, and indeed, if the 
statute were on the books and allowed to take affect once this challenge
 is disposed of, I am confident that the meaning would become much more 
well-accepted.</p>
<p>And the Petitioners have invited the Court, and this is on page 87 of their opening brief, to look at their website.</p>
<p>And of course that's outside the record, but to the extent that the 
Court looks at it, the Court will see that Petitioners refer to their 
bankruptcy practice as providing debt relief.</p>
<p>We think that's a natural way of -- of pitching what the services 
made available by a bankruptcy attorney are: Relief from one's debts.</p>
<p>So we don't think there is anything wrong with that term.</p>
<p>But I do want to turn back to why it's not correct to say that a debt
 relief agency would ever not -- not help people file for bankruptcy 
relief under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>That is because, as I understand Petitioners' argument, it's that an assisted person might be a creditor.</p>
<p>That is not correct.</p>
<p>The definition of "assisted person" turns on having nonexempt property in excess of a certain amount.</p>
<p>Under section 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code, and indeed under this 
Court's decision in Owen v. Owen, there is no exempt property until 
there is a filing for bankruptcy and an assembly of the bankruptcy 
estate and a filing by the debtor, or someone on the debtor's behalf, 
filing schedules that specify what property the debtor has and which 
exemptions the debtor chooses to claim.</p>
<p>That is only done when there is a debtor.</p>
<p>Creditors don't do that.</p>
<p>Creditors don't have nonexempt property.</p>
<p>We don't think a creditor could be an assisted person.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: How about a law firm that represents the biggest companies in the world?</p>
<p>And so they are never going to consciously, intentionally seek out or
 represent a person defined with the financial limitations of this 
category.</p>
<p>But it so happens that one of their very rich clients comes in and 
says, I have a small -- my brother-in-law is running a small business; 
help him or her.</p>
<p>Is that firm in violation now because their advertisements did not include what 528(a) required?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: Well, first, Justice Sotomayor, if, for example, they do it 
pro bono, then it wouldn't -- then it wouldn't trigger the definition at
 all.</p>
<p>But assuming that the brother-in-law pays for the services, then yes.</p>
<p>I mean, yes--</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: So they have to -- for this one 
brother-in-law, they have to amend -- they're now violated the statute 
ex post facto somehow?</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --Not ex post facto, Justice Sotomayor.</p>
<p>They would become a debt relief agency, and thereafter, 
advertisements directed to the public that advertise those specific 
services, and if they don't have a bankruptcy practice at all, or don't 
advertise the services that are listed in section 528, then the 
disclaimer requirement doesn't apply at all.</p>
<p>But if they then chose--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: If they're -- if they're, as the hypothetical
 suggests, representing only big companies, they're probably not 
advertising to the general public anyway.</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --That -- that may well be.</p>
<p>Well, they may have a website, Justice Scalia, but big firms have to 
deal already with multifarious disclaimer requirements in every State 
where they practice, and firm websites often have a lengthy set of 
disclaimers; you know, one required by Texas, and one required by New 
York, and so on.</p>
<p>This is something that -- that multijurisdictional firms are already 
familiar with, and they provide these disclaimers without problem.</p>
<p>And--</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: You said that one of the aspects of this
 that makes it horrible is that they are not limited to saying,</p>
<p>"We are debt relief agencies; we help people file for bankruptcy. "</p>
<p>They can say anything else.</p>
<p>But there's no screening -- there is no administrator that a law firm can go to and say,</p>
<p>"This is what I -- this is what I think is substantially similar. "</p>
<p>"Is it okay? "</p>
<p>Mr. Jay: --That is true, Justice Ginsburg, and there is of course the safe harbor.</p>
<p>By using this two-sentence statement, the advertiser is certain that there will be no problem.</p>
<p>But I think that -- that a substantially -- a substantially similar 
statement is a permissive standard, and if there would be any 
constitutional doubt, it would be to resolve it in favor of flexibility 
in that regard.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Thank you, Counsel.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad, you have three minutes remaining.</p>
<p>REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR. ON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &amp; MILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Thank you.</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg, your example about the woman who is in need of medical attention falls squarely within the statute.</p>
<p>The lawyer would be prohibited from advising her to incur debt to get
 needed medical attention, and the government, in trying to articulate a
 way around that during the course of the argument, articulated no less 
than five different standards.</p>
<p>The conduct would have to be fraudulent or unethical or abusive or criminal or improper.</p>
<p>None of those are in the statute, and it's impossible to know which one.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Roberts, you are absolutely right: What this statute 
does is it's basically trying to interfere with the attorney-client 
relationship, and even moreso on the side of "or pay an attorney".</p>
<p>And Justice Breyer, here's how it works.</p>
<p>The client comes to -- the prospective client comes to the lawyer and is in trouble.</p>
<p>And may not know whether the client has to file for bankruptcy or not.</p>
<p>So there is a conversation that happens.</p>
<p>And in that conversation, it may be decided that the best thing for 
the client to do is to file for bankruptcy, and of course, the client 
will have to know: How am I going to pay for this?</p>
<p>Well, there are two ways.</p>
<p>One, the client can pay the attorney in full, up front, or the attorney can take payment over time.</p>
<p>However, this all happens before bankruptcy, so there is no involvement of the Court at this point.</p>
<p>If the attorney accepts payment over time, which many do, because 
it's very expensive to file for bankruptcy now and most debtors don't 
have the wherewithal, the attorney, by saying, I take payment over time,
 and the debtor accepting that, the debtor would be incurring debt in 
contemplation of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Incurring debt to the attorney.</p>
<p>The attorney would be proscribed, under the statute, from actually giving that particular advice.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: What the attorney says is, Here's what we 
will do; when we file for bankruptcy, I will ask the Court to approve my
 own fees as something that is continuing after bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Exactly.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: And he says, This is what they will be.</p>
<p>So what is the harm--</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Because you can't--</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: --since that's what he has to do, of making him tell his client that that's what he has to do?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Because you can't advise the client in advance to incur that debt.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: No, you -- you can't?</p>
<p>This prevents you had from saying, What I'm going to do is ask the bankruptcy judge to approve what I just said?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Well, that has to happen anyway under section--</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Of course.</p>
<p>And so what's wrong with the law that tells the lawyer that's what he has to tell the client?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --Because there, in that situation, you would be advising the client to incur the debt.</p>
<p>Remember, it's advising the client to incur the debt, not the actual incurrence of the debt.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: I don't read the hypothetical that you have given as coming within the statute.</p>
<p>I think what -- what it means: Incurred debt to pay an attorney, I don't think it means debt to the attorney.</p>
<p>You are not worried about the attorney cheating himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Well, except debt--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: Making himself an additional creditor.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --But debt is--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: What it talks about is inducing the client to -- to borrow money from somebody else to pay the attorney.</p>
<p>You know, and that seems to be perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --I think it includes both, Justice Scalia.</p>
<p>For example, you couldn't advises your client to borrow $1,000 from your mother.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: That's right.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: And you couldn't -- and you also, I think, advise a client to basically borrow money from you, the attorney.</p>
<p>You're extending services on credit; that's incurring a debt.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: Why -- why would you worry about the attorney, you know, hurting himself?</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: Because the statute--</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia: It makes no sense.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunstad: --It's at least unclear, Justice Scalia, and that is the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>It's very unclear.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts: Thank you, Counsel.</p>
<p>The case is submitted.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Chief Justice Mr. Chief Justice Robers Jr.: Justice Sotomayor has the
 opinion this morning in case 08-1119, Milavetz, Gallop, &amp; Milavetz 
versus All State Insurance and the consolidated case.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: With limited exceptions, the bankruptcy 
abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 defines the term 
debt relief agency to include any person who provides bankruptcy 
assistance to an assisted person for payment or who is a bankruptcy 
petition for payer.</p>
<p>The Act imposes certain restrictions on professionals who meet that definition.</p>
<p>As relevant to this litigation, the Act prohibits them from advising 
clients to incur more debts in contemplation of filing for bankruptcy, 
and it requires them to make certain disclosures in their advertisement.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in this litigation, a law firm and others, to whom I 
refer collectively as Milavetz filed a pre-enforcement action seeking 
declaratory relief.</p>
<p>Milavetz contends that attorneys are not debt relief agencies under 
the Act and therefore are not bound by its advice and disclosure rules.</p>
<p>In the alternative, Milavetz argues that the advice and disclosure rules are unconstitutional as applied to attorneys.</p>
<p>The District Court granted summary judgment for Milavetz.</p>
<p>The Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>
<p>It agreed with the government that attorneys are debt relief 
agencies, and that the Act's disclosure requirements are valid as 
applied to attorneys.</p>
<p>But it upheld the District Court's judgment that the advice 
restrictions broadly prescribed the provisions of probational advice and
 thus run afoul of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>We granted certiorari to resolve a circuit conflict regarding the scope of the advice provision.</p>
<p>We first conclude that the Act defines debt relief agency to include attorneys.</p>
<p>As the Eighth Circuit found, the bankruptcy assistance that 
circumscribes the relevant class of professionals, include several 
services commonly performed by attorneys, including some such as the 
provision of legal representation with respect to a case of proceeding, 
that can be performed only by attorneys.</p>
<p>We also find it significant that in enumerating specific exceptions 
to the definition of debt relief agency, Congress did not list 
attorneys.</p>
<p>Milavetz counter arguments do not persuade us to disregard the plain language of the definition.</p>
<p>Next, we reject the Eighth Circuit broad reading of the Acts advice restriction.</p>
<p>11 USC code 5026 A4 and conclude that it prohibits debt relief 
agencies only from advising a debtor to incur more debt because the 
debtor is filing for bankruptcy rather than for a valid purpose.</p>
<p>We have previously construed the phrase in contemplation of filing 
for bankruptcy to indicate that the expectation of filing induced or 
held the conduct in question.</p>
<p>Accordingly we construe 526 A4 to prohibit only implies that it induced or compelled by the prospect of the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In practice, such advice will generally consist of encouragement to 
load up on debt with the expectation of obtaining its discharge.</p>
<p>The statutory context supports the conclusion that section 526 A4 primarily targets this type of conduct.</p>
<p>We reject Milavetz arguments in favor of a broader reading of the 
restriction as well as its claim that the provision as narrowly 
construed is impermissibly vague.</p>
<p>Finally, we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the Act’s disclosure 
requirements codified in 11 USC code Section 528 are valid as applied to
 Milavetz, because those provisions are directed at misleading 
commercial speech and impose a disclosure requirement rather than 
affirmative limitation.</p>
<p>We conclude as we did in Zauderer versus Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel that the requirements need only be reasonably related to the 
government's interest in preventing consumer deception.</p>
<p>We find that the challenge disclosure requirements satisfy that standard as applied to Milavetz.</p>
<p>For the reasons summarized here and further elaborated in our opinion.</p>
<p>We affirm the Eighth Circuit judgment as to the definition of debt 
relief agency, and the validity of the Act’s disclosure provisions, and 
we reverse as to the scope of the advice provision.</p>
<p>The consolidated cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p>Justices Scalia and Thomas have filed opinions concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>
