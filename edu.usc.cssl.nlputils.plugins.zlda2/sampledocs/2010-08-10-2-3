
    []Americas greatest senator has perished in the usual terrible way of politicians in planes over Alaska, according to the local teevee news in Anchorage. Sarah Palin has pledged to stop Muslims from building a mosque at the site of the tragic crash.
 
    David Denby is crying and masturbating furiously, somewhere near the World Trade Center site. Levi Johnston has been named provisional Senate Pro Tem/Jesus Pope of Alaska.
 
    This is pretty much all the news, except for the now-forgotten Jobs Bill, which will be defeated in honor of Ted Stevens life of Fiscal Conservatism and Small Government Values. [KTTU]

                As for Ted Stevens, I can offer a fitting eulogy, ahem When he was alive his nonstop bitterness and disregard for any man who didnt fuck alaskan brown bears was palpable. That he aided in the rise of Sarah Palin was a corruption of the soul. His conscience was soiled just like John Boehners shorts when he spies bronzer on sale. He was one of many wingnuts who could insist upon forcing his phony religious morality upon others, while having none of his own. He helped spoil his state by allowing oil companies to turn it from natural splendor into a honeycombhe was an asshole, a wingnut and most of all, an Alaskan. RIP you corrupt grizzly bear raper

                   Inouye, Daniel K.
 
                   Rank and organization: Second Lieutenant, U.S. Army, Company E, 442nd Infantry. Place and date: San Terenzo, Italy, 21 April 1945. Birth: 7 September 1924, Honolulu, Hawaii. Entered service at: Honolulu, Hawaii.
 
                Citation:
                Second Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 21 April 1945, in the vicinity of San Terenzo, Italy. While attacking a defended ridge guarding an important road junction, Second Lieutenant Inouye skillfully directed his platoon through a hail of automatic weapon and small arms fire, in a swift enveloping movement that resulted in the capture of an artillery and mortar post and brought his men to within 40 yards of the hostile force. Emplaced in bunkers and rock formations, the enemy halted the advance with crossfire from three machine guns. With complete disregard for his personal safety, Second Lieutenant Inouye crawled up the treacherous slope to within five yards of the nearest machine gun and hurled two grenades, destroying the emplacement. Before the enemy could retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a second machine gun nest. Although wounded by a sniper??s bullet, he continued to engage other hostile positions at close range until an exploding grenade shattered his right arm. Despite the intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to direct his platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men were again deployed in defensive positions. In the attack, 25 enemy soldiers were killed and eight others captured. By his gallant, aggressive tactics and by his indomitable leadership, Second Lieutenant Inouye enabled his platoon to advance through formidable resistance, and was instrumental in the capture of the ridge. Second Lieutenant Inouye??s extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.
