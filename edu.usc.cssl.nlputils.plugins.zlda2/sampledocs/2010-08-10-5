 
Fox analyst slams Republicans on 14th Amendment politics
 
Judge Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News analyst and no screaming liberal, became the latest conservative to call out the Dred Scott Republicans for their ridiculous politicking on immigration--repealing or amending the 14th Amendment. Think Progress has the story and video.

NAPOLITANO: The law has been upheld uniformly since 1868 and without exception. And we start with a couple of basics. The Congress cannot change the constitution of the 14th amendment on its own. It takes 2/3 of each house of Congress and 3/4 of the states to change the amendment. [...] so this is nothing but political chatter by those who are concerned understandably by problems at the border. [...] I cant imagine that thered be a consensus to change the 14th amendment. [...]

HEMMER: But if the [Birthright Citizenship Act] were carried out, you had 100 co-sponsors about a year ago, it would require at least one parent to be a US citizen for a baby to become an American citizen at birth. If you were to enact the BCA as some refer to it, is that a way to get around the 14th amendment, and get done what people like John Cornyn, and John Kyl and John McCain, and we heard John Boehner are trying to do.

NAPOLITANO: No! That would not be a a way around it. There is no way to get around the 14th amendment. These people took an oath to uphold the Constitution whether they agree with it or not! All of it not part of it! The Supreme Court has said you cannot take privileges or benefits away from a child because of a crime committed by the parent. Therefore everybody born here is an American citizen, no matter what their parents status was at their birth.

It is just so much "political chatter" intended to drive the immigration wedge in further, playing to the absolute worst instincts of the base. Lindsey Graham is slimy, but he's smart enough to know all of the things that Napolitano lays out above, and that when he calls for a repeal of a constitutional amendment, it's not going to happen. What's really sad for America is that what should be the loyal opposition in Congress is so afraid of primary challenges from the crazy right that they're willing to forego their oath to the Constitution.

I'd say it will be 2016 at the earliest before we see Republican candidates who we can look at and really respect in leadership positions.

I haven't heard of any of them calling for the repeal of the 14th amendment. What they have been saying is that the law is not clear on whether a child of two illegal immigrants (or undocumented aliens, not trying to be poltical incorrect, :-)) is covered by the phrase born in the US and "subject to the laws thereof."

I'm not an immigration lawyer, but my understanding is that there is some interesting law on who is subject to what law. For instance, if someone is an overstay, entered legally but didn't leave when they were supposed to, they are in a different class as to what law applies, than those who entered illegally (snuck across the border.) People who are arrested at the airport and held in prison inside the US are considered to have never entered the US.

I don't know what the Supremes have or have not said on the subject and if what they said involved both parents being undocumented or not, and if the case in which they said it involved a child of two undocumented aliens, but I find it an interesting question of constitutional law.

Which is not to deny that the only reason that it is being raised is to rally the repub base and the only reason our side is saying "they want to repeal the 14th Amendment" is to rally out base. On that level it's just nonesense as usual.

The Wong case, which is the one always cited, involved the child of legal immigrants from China who decided to return to China. Their child went to China and came back. The issue was if he was a citizen here. Even though the Supreme Court said that that Congress only intended to exclude diplomats etc., this was dicta as the Wong case since Wong only involved legal immigrants. I still think if this Supreme Court wanted to revisit the issue they could do so without overruling Wong.

of a crime? If an undocumented worker robs a liquor store, is arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to prison, sounds like he's subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. To argue that an undocumented person is not subject to the jurisdiction of the US would be to argue that he's immune to prosecution and can commit any crime he wishes without fear of the police and court system.

But, I'm not a lawyer either, and I still don't understand how a corporation, an inanimate object, could be granted all the rights of a human being.

- ()

is a clue. Diplomats are only subject to the laws of the host country by the consent of their government and, in legal fact, work and reside "in" their nations. That is why attending a cultural event at an embassy really is a little trip to that nation, at least in a legal sense. Everybody else is subject to the laws of the United States, whether DAR to the max or an hour over the fence.

The really interesting case would be those either "in transit" or rejected at ports of entry. I've spent quite a few hours looking out on countries I've never been "in" from airport transit lounges awaiting onward flights. No passport stamp, no record I was even there other than passenger lists and maybe a photo of mine. At the same time I expect I was subject to some part of the laws there if I'd say become violent or committed rape or robbery. Then again, maybe it would be as if I were still on the aircraft and subject to the laws of the airline's (or ship's) nationality. There we get into real limbo.

As an interesting side issue we have those cruise ships. Aboard most you are in a sort of legal limbo, a criminal is in a sort of paradise, and strange things can happen. Do people really think Liberian (or any other odd flag of convenience nation) national police will investigate your disappearance, murder or rape? The U.S. is taking some action for ships routinely operating out of U.S. ports. That does not mean you have U.S. protection and it has resulted in some lines simply moving a bit off shore. That is why you may find your cruise departing from the Bahamas instead of Port Everglades.

How To Easily Win Debate over Birthright Citizenship/14th Am.

*****

Right now, I can prove I'm a citizen with proving my place of birth. Proving place of birth can be done by My mom or dad or the hospital or birth certificate; or even just the fact I've lived in one place for a long time, or went to kindergarten, is SOME proof of birthplace.

But under the New Rule, I'd have to prove the citizenship of one of my parents, too. How would I do that? RIght now, I could prove their citizenship by showing their birth certificate, etc. Under the New Rule, I'd have to prove the citizenship of one of parents by proving the citizenship of one of my grandparents. Which means proving the citizenship of one of my great grandparents.

So is it unworkable? No, not if the government maintains a list of citizens with identification permanently so that I simply name my parents and they would be in the database. Then I'd be in the database and my kids would be able to meet the proof needed. And then their kids.

In other words, you'll need a national ID card to make it work. Maybe you wouldn't have to carry a card, but your grandparents...and ever other citizen.... are going to have to be in a database of approved bona fide citizens.

So that's what ends the debate. There's probably two of us in the country that wouldn't mind a national ID card and/or a database of who is a citizen with identifying info. Everyone else....and particularly a teabagger....is freaked out by the very thought of it. There is nobody that is going to allow the government to make judgments or maintain a database of citizens. They won't even allow us to know who has how many guns.

************

,

My ancestors came here in the late 18th century. I'm pretty sure a great, great, great, great grandfather came over as an indentured servant who ran away before fulfilling his servitude. I guess that would make him an illegal alien. Since he was here illegally, his children would not be citizens, thus their children would not be citizens, etc, Leading to me.

Of course, considering my politics, the Repubs would probably be happy to deny my citizenship.

- ()
the point of my diary was that ANY rule needs a database, even one grandfathered going forward, and people HATE the idea of databases of citizens.
 
- ()

wetbacks that had been here a generation or so before 1776 or the United States itself as our direct ancestors? Just happened to be here without permission of the U.S. at the time. The King probably wasn't much interested either. Bet the pension papers of my Continental and state militia ancestors won't count as proper "papers" so I'd better keep my passport current.

Even that might not count if Myerson's idea floats.

So, the question for Lindsey Graham is: Are you serious about revoking the citizenship of 4 million children, their children and their children's children? How about a package deal: Stripping their citizenship in return for stripping the citizenship of Confederate descendants. A sort of Missouri Compromise for our times. Bipartisanship in action.

After all, on both sides, I am in the sticky wicket of having had these too:

The Confederates had renounced all allegiance to the United States.

And the 14th has some application there too.

- ()

Have you ever lived in Europe? (I have for many years). Been there recently?

It so happens that EVERY SINGLE nation in the EU has uniform citizenship laws now, and they don't include automatic birthright citizenship. While the children of legal permanent residents are citizens (with a few exceptions, - like babies born to US servicemembers), the ones born to tourists or illegal immigrants are not. Yes, those "repug", and "right-wing" european countries apparently know something we don't.

Even before the EU, it wasn't the law of the land anymore. Several countries like Britain ditched their birthright citizenship laws in the 1980s, seeing (correctly) that they don't work very well in the modern age of rampant travel and tourism.

So what's my point? My point is that in the EU, there is no massive problem in doing this. No database problems. No panic. No confusion over the system. No hoards of "stateless" people wandering around (as some other commenters have suggested).

Here's what some people don't understand:

1) Everyone gets a birth certificate in the EU! Even tourists and illegal residents. This has nothing to do with citizenship. It's just proof of your birth. In most cases, a foreigner's local embassy also generates a report of birth.

2) When determining the citizenship status of the child, you simply go to the citizenship/immigration status of the parents. It's really not complicated. Sometimes the parents don't have a National ID card. They don't need one. They just present what documentation they have to an official, and that's that. The hospital is not involved here - they doesn't make any determination other than when or where a child was born.

Incidentally, it's not just the EU, of course. Very few nations in the world still practice automatic birthright citizenship. It's basically limited to the Americas only. Canada and the US are the only developed nations in the world still doing it.

- ()
you simply go to the citizenship/immigration status of the parents.
 
It's precisely that database that few people will tolerate.
 
- ()
1) First of all, there already are such "databases" in the US. Have you even traveled outside the country? All entries and exits are recorded at the port of entry/exit when your passport is checked. Additionally, ICE keeps a database of everyone who has applied for legal residency.

2) You wouldn't need the "database" anyway. Any legal alien resident has their resident card (called a "green card"), or other documentation. I don't see where this "problem" would exist. Certainly, other countries don't have a problem with it.

- ()
It must have been so long ago that you've never seen anyone react to the idea of a government ID.
 
OF COURSE you are in various databases if you leave the country. First, lots of people aren't happy about that. Second, that's why lots of people don't leave the country.
 
Third, you think that making legal aliens carry green cards makes a difference. If my parents were citizens and not legal aliens, I'm not going to HAVE a green card. How would I prove their citizenship? Well, by showing what the equivalent of a green card is for an american showing legal residence, which is a card that does not exist and doesn't exist because people HATE the idea.
 
- ()
There's one simple answer to your question, and people do it all the time. How do you register to vote? There are various methods to prove your citizenship. It's not terribly difficult.
 
Another method is simply to show your Social Security card (Resident aliens get cards stamped "resident alien" at the top).
 
- ()
How do you register to vote?
 
By assuming everyone who is a resident is entitled. But if someone is arguing that there shouldn't be birth citizenship, noting that there's no enforcement at the polling place wouldn't help any. It would simply be another problem.
 
Another method is simply to show your Social Security card (Resident aliens get cards stamped "resident alien" at the top).
 
You mean, the card that says "Not For Identification Purposes?"
 
What you are suggesting aren't things that work. You're suggesting things that won't. That doesn't end the debate, it calls the good faith of the debaters into question.
 
- ()
 
How do you register to vote?
 
By assuming everyone who is a resident is entitled.
 
In some areas yes, although that is often a recipe for trouble, since non-US citizens are not allowed to vote. However, the same principle can apply here too: Simply assume, in good faith, that any parents who claim they are citizens or claim they are in the country legally are telling the truth. If it turns out later that they aren't, then the parents can be charged with fraud.
 
 Another method is simply to show your Social Security card (Resident aliens get cards stamped "resident alien" at the top).
 
You mean, the card that says "Not For Identification Purposes?"
 
Oh come on. What do you think the card is for? You can use the card to prove your SSN. If you show it along with a Passport, driver's license, etc, then there is no problem.
 
Once again, you are trying to create a problem where it doesn't exist, even in nations of the world that aren't wealthy enough to demand documentation for everything.
 
- ()
Simply assume, in good faith, that any parents who claim they are citizens or claim they are in the country legally are telling the truth.
 
Well, sure. Then it doens't MATTER what the rule is, does it, because de facto, a person's ability to vote depends on whatever comes out of their mouth, lies, truth, mistake, whatever.
 
But how does that "end the debate" over citizenship? It doesn't: it merely tells the people looking for the change that you have no intention of enforcing it, that you're going to make it into a big joke, no matter what the constitutiona says.
 
What do you think the card is for?
 
Well, once again, you seem to think that the best way out of the conundrum is to have crappy, easily forgible "idenftification" and leave it at that. How does that "end the debate"? It doesn't. It simply puts bad faith into the mix, suggesting that we have a strict and onerous rule of citizenship on the books and just all live with the fact we will assume everyone's a citizen.  Of course, that's pretty much the way the immigration law is today. How's that working out? Debate over, yet?
 
Seriously, your contribution to the issue of enforcment is to suggest that it NOT be. I could have done that myself.
 
- ()
Sure no system is perfect - but guess what? It's not perfect now!!
 
And while the current system to register to vote could certainly be improved, I would hardly call it a "joke". So I don't think any change to birthright citizenship would be a "joke" either.
 
SSN cards can be forged, yes. But here's a news flash: so can birth certificates!! It happens all the time. Gee, big flaw in your reasoning?
 
Seriously, your contribution to the issue of enforcment is to suggest that it NOT be. I could have done that myself.
 
How you have concluded that from all the above is beyond me, short of deliberately trying to confuse the issue to cover your pathetic arguments. There are two methods of enforcement - check at every turn, or trust but prosecute when suspicion arises (such as the IRS does). Either method might work here. But neither require a new bureaucracy or a national identity card, or anything of the sort. This is such a non-issue in other countries that your worries are truly pitiful.
 
- ()
Sure no system is perfect - but guess what? It's not perfect now!!
 
Which is what's causing the debate. The only thing that would make more heated debate is people designing a system of enforcement with the express desire that it fail.
 
are two methods of enforcement - check at every turn, or trust but prosecute when suspicion arises (such as the IRS does).
 
Either one requires a database. The IRS has extensive reporting requirements so that you are able to prove (or it is able to disprove) your liability when it decides it is suspicious. Your W-2s, your w-4s, your payments to independent contractors, your past returns, every bank deposit of $10,000 or more goes into a bigass database so that the issue of taxes, IF it is ever raised, can be resolved. Because there's no way to determine taxes unless someone keeps the paperwork, and no means of enforcment unless there's reporting. Any rule aside from birth citizenship would also require keeping the paperwork, and what it would lack in detail, it would gain in having to be permanent.
 
Thanks for playing, though. It's been fun. Let me know if there's any other person on the planet who doesn't agree with my point.

... wouldn't get birthright citizenship?!

I mean, don't get me wrong. I oppose amending the 14th and I don't support abolishing any form of birthright citizenship (esp. considering the whole phenomenon of people sneaking across the border just to give birth is a total urban legend). But at least the idea of preventing undocumented immigrants' kids from becoming citizens is, theoretically speaking, relatively sane.

But now Republicans are saying that even legal immigrants' kids can't get citizenship at birth?! There goes three centuries of - extraordinarily successful! - American immigration policy - policy that led to this country being what it is.

- ()

It's not.

What country would these children be citizens of, if not the one they're born in? They're not going to have Mexican citizenship--they weren't born there.

They'll be state-less children, under no one's jurisdiction nor protection.

And, in any event, the 14th Amendment is very, very clear on the point--it does not make any mention of the parents' immigration status (primarily because the entire notion of "illegal immigration" is a 20th century construction).

- ()
... it's "sane" relative to rescinding ALL birthright citizenship. Otherwise, I'm in agreement.
 
- ()
... ANY watering-down of birthright citizenship, for exactly the reasons you point out.
 
- ()
....OF THEIR PARENTS!!!
 
What's so hard to understand about that? They would be citizens of the country that has JURISDICTION of their parents.
 
- ()
,

There's no international law regarding that, and U.S. law cannot confer another country's citizenship upon people. We lack the jurisdiction to do so.

I know it's a hard concept for most Americans, but our laws end at our borders.

- ()

...US law has nothing to do with the citizenship of the child of citizens of foreign countries.

What country denies citizenship to a child of it's citizens who are born outside the country's boundaries?

And why would the US law have something to do with the children of citizens of foreign countries? Your argument makes no sense.

We're not talking about U.S. law having anything to do with the children of citizens of foreign countries, except when those children are born in the United States.
 
What you're suggesting is telling other countries they have to accept persons born here as citizens of their countries.

who is elsewhere advocating extensive "reform" of the Constitution.
 
As with most people in this country there is damn little knowledge of how varied citizenship can be on the full spectrum from "by blood" to "born on the soil" basic concepts.
 
We are seeing a current aggressive "by blood" in Eastern Europe at the moment, maybe not quite as virulent as German claims of the 1930s, but with trouble making potential. Some countries do a combination. We are, along with a number of "new" nations of immigrants, are strongly into the "soil" side. That is logical for a nation of all immigrants trying to apply European ideas of nationhood in what was really someone else's country.
 
We also have the situation where "blood" can combine with "soil" to require dual citizenship. I remember having to answer questions on arrival at basic training about parentage and whether certain national/ethnic names were involved. At the time there was particular concern about French surnames. Simply having a core French name could make one "French" if serving on French territory and thus such assignments would be avoided for say someone from Maine's French heritage.
 
That still applies to many nations in which someone with ancestry in the nation is required to have that nation's passport to visit. The same can happen to a child of U.S. citizens born on the soil of a nation with that access to citizenship. Remember too, not all nations allow or easily grant any renunciation of citizenship. If John McCain had been born in some countries, even in a military hospital, he might have to carry another passport to return for a visit.
 
We have had some interesting incidents in our own history. I believe one can find more than one case of a person tried as a U.S. citizen who was born here and returned to the parent's native country as a minor and then ran afoul of the U.S. If I remember correctly there were both some Germans and Japanese during the wartime years that found themselves "traitors" even though they barely remembered the U.S.

NO ONE is suggesting "telling other countries" to accept anyone.
 
It happens automatically. Since you referred to Wikipedia, I will too:

Any child born to Mexican parents is a Mexican citizen, regardless of where they were born. This is known as jus sanguinis, and it's also the policy in virtually every other nation in the world.
 
- ()

and I should know, since my grandson was born in Switzerland. He does not have Swiss citizenship. It's up to his parents to get his citizenship of their country.

- ()

...jus soli does not exist in Switzerland (see http://en.wikipedia.org/... ).

Statelessness is a potential risk if neither parents' country of origin extends jus sanguinis.

Rights, to which the US is a signatory (and arguably, principal architect), states:

Everyone has the right to a nationality.

- ()

Mexico, like the US, (and like virtually all other nations in the world) grants citizenship to the children born of their own citizens, regardless of where they are born.

So currently, Mexicans born in the US have dual Mexican/US citizenship. There are no "stateless" people here.

- ()

If the 14th were re-examined, it's more likely that just children of illegal immigrants and tourists would not automatically get citizenship (which is the policy with most of the rest of the world, including the EU).

And, your quote:

the whole phenomenon of people sneaking across the border just to give birth is a total urban legend

Are you joking? Look here, for starters:

Last year at Parkland [Memorial Hospital in Dallas], 11,071 babies were born to women who were noncitizens, about 74 percent of total deliveries.

prolifers make about the rights of the unborn? You don't penalize an innocent, defenseless unborn by subjecting them to the whims of a mother's rash decision. The state has to step in and proect these unborn children's rights. BUT when it comes to the unborn of illegal immigrants, they are fine with taking the citizen rights away. I wonder if the 14th Amendmenters would be OK with forced abortion of illegal immigrant women--that would solve their 14th Amendment problem?!

FOX today, and Rachel went over it on MSNBC last night.

I have been an advocate of the change. Much to the dismay of folks on this site and others! I don't like illegal immigration (not the people, the fact that it's happening). Seemed like it would be a disincentive to come over here and start a family if that family were to be bereft of social services....which are well known to be available here in the states.

So here's the deal, not everyone knows how difficult it is to change the Constitution. I didn't. I guess I learned it in school, but I sure don't remember learning it! I would venture, that most others are as clueless as I.  :)

Listening to Rach explain it last night, and reading what Napolitano said today....it makes me think completely different about the whole thing. I still don't like the circumstances, but that's just too bad. The Constitution is there for a reason, it's tremendously difficult to change for a reason.....and I loved what Napolitano said about the Supreme Court and children. It's lovely, it's fair, and it just.

So rather than calling folks like me ignorant, stupid, assholes, blah......next time educate!!! Education is a wonderful thing, it opens peoples eyes to other possibilites and ideas. Very few are truely "stupid", many are uneducated in one or more areas.

It is treasonous against the citizens of this country what the conservative side of the aisle is doing. They are spouting off BS that they are incapable of achieving in an effort to appeal to folks anger on a hot button issue. They should be educatiing their constituents on the reality of what the Constitution says, why it says it, how difficult it is to change it and why. They are truely in treason to the very Constitution that they swear to uphold. BTW---the def of treason I refer to is a betrayal after trust.

it should not even be attempted?
 
And you throw around the term "treason" pretty loosely.
 
Are people who want to ban guns guilty of "treason"? What about the ones who supported the (failed) Equal Rights Amendment? Are they all traitors?
 
- ()
So what I'm about to say is a very uninformed opionion. Here goes:
 
Firstly, I was actually trying to let people know that by educating someone rather than excoriating them, they may get them to understand and come around to their way of thinking. I was using my personal example on this topic, to make that point.
 
Secondly, I have no idea when it's right and not right to change the Constitution. However, I have a newfound respect for not attempting to change it willy nilly. I also have a better understanding of why/how the difficulties are there to attempting a change! That's all!
 
Check dictionary.com...a valid and correct definition of treason is betrayal after trust. And yes, it accurately describes people, and institutions sometimes.
 
I don't think of someone as being traitorous because they want to change the 14th amendment because they don't like the anchor baby issue. What I think is traitorous is when GOP leaders (who know better) start spouting off this crap to an uninformed and angry base of people. They know they can't really change this amendment. So why go around rabble rousing and getting people more jacked-up than they already are. These people in Congress are supposed to represent us. Part of that could be to educate us on the realities of things sometimes. But they are all a bunch of two bit whores, and unruly toddlers when it comes to leadership, so what they do instead is appeal to our baser instincts. I include the Dems in this scurrilous behaviour by the way.
 
So re banning guns. I don't think badly of people who want to ban them. I don't think anyone is trying to change the Constitution on this though. So it's not the same sort of situation.

I really don't think it's a bad idea to change the Constitution in this matter. I don't understand why someone who is merely born on our soil is automatically a citizen. Do other countries allow this type of thing? If so, I'm kinda pissed I didn't take my wife to Switzerland or Sweden and have my kids born there. That way at least they'd have medical coverage if something terrible ever happened to them.

I think this part of the of the 14th antiquated and should be changed. Just because it's the law of the land does not mean it's right.

had been born in Pakistan or Jamaica or Fiji they would have been granted citizenship there, but not in Switzerland or Sweden. No European country grants automatic citizenship to children of parents who are not at the very least, legal residents.

The Old World long has closely associated ethnic "blood" with nationality, often with really bad consequences. Empires were more generous, Roman citizenship extended far beyond Rome and Italy, and then came the waves of armed "tribal" movement after the collapse and a mass of kingdoms based on language, blood and conquest. Real trouble ensued. Thus we had Germany declaring citizens of other nations "oppressed Germans" in the 1930s.
 
The "New World" saw a combination and the hunt for Europeans to populate the place led to very different concepts with the U.S. being heavily weighted to "born here you are a citizen" gaining an eventual formalized place in the 14th Amendment to settle another question on the subject about Africans coming out of property status.

It's what America is all about. "All men are created equal."

All children are entitled to a nationality. Where you were born makes as much sense as where your parents were born. Or where one of your parents was born, because no guarantee they're from the same place.

By the way, having an American child does not give the parent any legal rights to stay in the US. Only adults can sponsor family members for legal residency.

- ()
That phrase has NOTHING to do with this debate, unless you are saying that US citizens are automatically superior to citizens of other countries. If that's true, then why not just award US citizenship to the entire world?
 
And it's true that having an American child does not give the parent automatic legal rights to stay in the US, but it is a huge wedge in their favor. It grants all sorts of welfare benefits for the child (varied by state) and at deportation hearings, it works in the parent's favor.

The Constitution is (or should be) a practical guide to maintaining order and civil rights in today's society with all it's complexity. It does not do that today. The notions about birthright citizenship are old and out dated. They became old and outdated when air travel became available to everybody.

Today, a person can be born a citizen of the US without even leaving the plane he/she just landed in. That's not a reasonable criteria for citizenship.

In "Why the GOP really wants to alter the 14th Amendment" he probably exposes the real driver of this idiocy and makes a fairly reasonable compromise proposal. Of course lots of us, including much of the GOP base, suddenly would become "visitors" here.

First:

By proposing to revoke the citizenship of the estimated 4 million U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants -- and, presumably, the children's children and so on down the line -- Republicans are calling for more than the creation of a permanent noncitizen caste. They are endeavoring to solve what is probably their most crippling long-term political dilemma: the racial diversification of the electorate. Not to put too fine a point on it, they are trying to preserve their political prospects as a white folks' party in an increasingly multicolored land.

Then the compromise:

The Confederates had renounced all allegiance to the United States. They made war on the United States -- the Constitution's definition of treason -- and, in an effort to keep 4 million Americans enslaved, killed more of our soldiers than any foreign army ever did.

and

So, the question for Lindsey Graham is: Are you serious about revoking the citizenship of 4 million children, their children and their children's children? How about a package deal: Stripping their citizenship in return for stripping the citizenship of Confederate descendants. A sort of Missouri Compromise for our times. Bipartisanship in action.

No one has proposed revoking the citizenship of anyone. We are only talking about changing the policy for the future.
