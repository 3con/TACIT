    New York City Transit Authority Gives The Green Light To Anti-Islam Ads Graphically Depicting 9/11 Attacks
    **********************************************************************************************************

    Self-described anti-jihadist and conservative blogger Pamela
    Geller has purchased advertising space on New York City buses for an ad
    that graphically depicts a plane about to crash into the World Trade
    Center. Geller is leading a crusade against the Ground Zero mosque,
    calling it "insensitive to the families and to America that was attacked
    on 9/11." The ad campaign features a phony sketch of the planned Ground
    Zero mosque, which appears to be as big as the Twin Towers and is
    labeled the "WTC Mega Mosque."

    New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority initially rejected the
    ad, telling Geller that images of the September 11 attacks were not
    allowed, according to her account of their conversations. Geller
    re-submitted the ad without any smoke near the towers, and a plane
    flying in the distance, not approaching the towers. When that was also
    rejected, Geller filed a lawsuit over the denial.

    Today, the MTA changed its position and accepted the most graphic
    version of the advertisement. Kevin Ortiz, an MTA spokesman, issued a
    brief statement Monday:

        While the MTA does not endorse the views expressed in this or other
        ads that appear on the transit system, the advertisement purchased
        by a group opposing a planned mosque near the World Trade Center was
        accepted today after its review under MTAs advertising guidelines
        and governing legal standards.

    The MTA's reversal is curious, considering that earlier this year it
    rejected advertisements from the Working Families Party that criticized
    Mayor Michael Bloomberg and cuts to New York bus and subway service. The
    ads resembled MTA posters, but substituted acronyms like "WTF" instead
    of subway lines.

    At the time, the MTA said the ads implied obscene language, and that ads
    that were "offensive, improper or in bad taste" could not be run.
    Apparently images of the Twin Towers being destroyed are not considered
    improper.
