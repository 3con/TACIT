Paterson: If 'Ground Zero Mosque' Moves, State Will Help

ALBANY, N.Y.  New York Gov. David Paterson offered state help Tuesday if the developers of a mosque near the site of the Sept. 11 attacks agree to move the project farther from the site.

Paterson, a Democrat, said that he doesn't oppose the project as planned but indicated that he understands where opponents are coming from. He said he was willing to intervene to seek other suitable state property if the developers agreed.

"I think it's rather clear that building a center there meets all the requirements, but it does seem to ignite an immense amount of anxiety among the citizens of New York and people everywhere, and I think not without cause," Paterson said in a news conference in Manhattan.

The developers declined to comment. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who last week made an impassioned defense of the project planned for lower Manhattan, declined to comment through a spokesman.

"I am very sensitive to the desire of those who are adamant against it to see something else worked out," Paterson said.

Paterson said he expects the state Public Service Commission, which must sign off on the Corboda Initiative's project, to follow the law and not politics in its review.

Paterson noted that "we really are still suffering in many respects" from Sept. 11 and that impassioned feelings were bound to emerge from a mosque just a couple of blocks from where nearly 3,000 people died at the hands of Muslim extremists.

He noted that Muslims died in the Sept. 11 attacks, too, and that "we have to remember that sometimes it's the fanaticism of religion that have driven people to do what they do, not the worship of the religion itself."

Supporters of the cultural center, including some Jewish activists, argue the aim of the Cordoba Initiative is to improve understanding of Islam. They point out that Muslims worshipped in the same area for a long time before the 13-story, $100 million proposal became public in May and was the subject of public hearings in the city and debate on television and radio nationwide.

Opponents note that the center will replace a building damaged by the landing gear of a jet that slammed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. They say the religion that fueled the hatred in the terrorists shouldn't be displayed so near to the site and in a place New Yorkers will have to pass daily.

A city board cleared the way for the existing building to be razed to make way for the center, which is to include athletic and arts facilities and be dedicated to peace and tolerance. Critics are suspicious of who will fund the project, and developers haven't released their sources of capital.

Carl Paladino, a Republican candidate for governor, said the plan is "no different than Japan asking to build a memorial to kamikaze pilots next to the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor."

Bloomberg argues, though, that it "would be untrue to the best part of ourselves, and who we are as New Yorkers and Americans, if we said no to a mosque in lower Manhattan."

The State Department said Tuesday that the imam behind the center was being sent on a religious outreach trip to the Middle East, a plan that predated the controversy.

The department is sponsoring Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf's visit to Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, where he will discuss Muslim life in America and promote religious tolerance, department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.

"We have a long-term relationship with him," Crowley told reporters, noting that Rauf had visited Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in 2007 and went to Egypt last January as part of a State Department exchange program.

A Marist College poll released Tuesday found that 53 percent of New York City voters polled oppose constructing the mosque there. Just 34 percent favored the plan in the poll, which also showed a slide in Bloomberg's traditional high approval ratings.

The Marist poll surveyed 696 New York City voters July 28 through Aug. 5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Stuart Whatley: Democratic Values, Islam and the Judeo-Christian Tradition Fallacy   Models for pluralistic societies based on liberal democratic values exist throughout the historical landscape, independent of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It bodes well that they may be freely adopted by all cultures.

Sally Steenland: Correcting the Distorted Lens of Islamophobia   We need to be more informed about Islam and its followers and push back against hate speech and fear-based rhetoric that lumps one of the world's greatest and most diverse faiths into a monolithic block.

Dean Obeidallah: Why Building the Mosque is Good for America!   Where can the Muslim community center be built in NYC? I say you can build it here or there, by a house or a mouse, in Tribeca by Robert DeNiro or further down by Ground Zero. It's that simple.

Raymond J. Learsy: A Mosque Perhaps, but a Swimming Pool?   Whether a mosque should be built so near the site is debatable, but to build a swimming pool -- where one is meant to come play and frolic -- smacks of gross insensitivity or worse yet, triumphalism.

Zahra Khan: The Potpourri Resolution for a Ground Zero Mosque   Adherents to Islam form a vulnerable racial minority before a prejudiced media that uses religious misnomers like "Islamic terrorist" to develop public support for attacking adherents to Islam, a word that literally means "Peace."

William Spear: The World Is Full of Ground Zeroes   After 9/11 and in the years since, I've watched the anti-Muslim drumbeat intensify in ways that impact multitudes of innocent people.

Dr. David P. Gushee: The Shameful Mosque Controversy   A longstanding effort to build a Muslim center that ended up being near what became "Ground Zero" has become Exhibit A in the contest between popular passion and constitutional principle.

The real crime here is that ANY religious group can dictate where it can establish a religious center. The idea that churches, mosques, etc are not subject to zoning laws and their organizations are not taxed is ridiculous in this day and age. These people are raking in billions and sitting on billions of dollars of untaxed real estate, and no doubt laughing all the way to the bank. This is like giving prime living conditions to a cancer spreading through your body instead of doing your best to kill it!!
 Rememmber, Faith Divides, Reason Unites.

So Guv, are you gonna set aside some state property land for my family and the Ramirez family to stay out of Bitsy and Scooter's neighborhood when they get unforcomfortable too?

The state will help. I see.
 
That means the tax payers of New York will incur an expensive in order bribe one group not to bother bigots with their presence. Isn't that rather the same in spirit as the old days when a community group or neighborhood association would offer to pay a black family a little something not to buy the house in an "unofficially" restricted white community? "Pay to go away" policy. How is it different?
 
It's different only in that here it's not just a private group of bigots, but instead makes it official state policy. And official state expense - with those tax dollars coming from the tax payments of people who don't agree with the bigotry or who may in fact be Muslim tax paying citizens.
 
Wow.

Does anyone remembers an old Wall Street company TV commercial in which two people are in a restaurant and one says to the other. ??When FixNews speak, everybody listen.
 The so called ??liberal media?? was listening to FAUX criticism of Michelle Obama??s vacation trip this weekend.

Since sitting in the front of the bus caused so much controversy how about we throw some comfortable pillows in the back if you agree to go sit back there.

Aren't we better than the detractors, the haters??

Briefly, the governor is exceeding his authority. He has neither the power to give land away nor to sell it. If he and the legislature tried to give land to a religious organization, there would be a howl about favoritism and about the Establishment Clause. Sale, a possibility, would have to be by auction or some other way of determing fair value.
 The proposed site is served by many subway lines and by the PATH trains from New Jersey. Any other site with such accessability, Midtown, for instance would be far more expensive.
 Indeed, I cannot understand what Governor Paterson brings to this controversy, except fueling divisiveness, as the local authorities have approved the Islamic Center with its prayer hall.

Patterson is a total coward. Period.

The battle over this center is so giving those behind 9/11 what they want. to show that we are hypocrites because we cry about how other faiths are treated in other countries and try and tell them how to live and yet when we have religious freedom many of our own people fight to remove that freedom from a faith they don't understand and don't stand behind. This center has gone from just this one to protest for on in TN....we can not as a nation let fear guide us. we have rules and laws and unless this group broke them they have a right as citizens of out country to have their center (with in the law). Just like that crazy church with in the law has a right to protest military funerals because of gays in the us. What is the saddest thing is we are all becoming that church.
 
drop the hate and drop the fear, educate yourself on what people of this truely believe not the extremist her hear about. best place to learn is to talk to someone of that faith.

TO THE IMAMS AND DEVELOPERS OF THE LOWER MANHATTAN MOSQUE:
 
Because you are fully aware that there is a lot of hate for America coming from your faith and the majority of recent terrorist attacks worldwide has been from self-proclaimed Muslims, you should show some sort of sensitivity to the victims of 9/11 and their families and not build your mosque 2 blocks from ground zero.

That would be surrendering to ignorance.

No, it would show compassion, humility and moral leadership.

Some of those victims were Muslims.

You are showing the worst of qualities of an American...and you are shaming yourself..!

"They say the religion that fueled the hatred in the terrorists shouldn't be displayed so near to the site..."

 I see. So Christianity doesn't fuel hatred. All the hatred that I've experienced since childhood because I'm gay wasn't ACTUALLY hatred. And the gay people who have been beaten and killed--why, I'm sure that hatred wasn't fueled by Christianity, either. I'm sure Anita Bryant's hatred wasn't fueled by Christianity. Must have been the orange juice.

One does not negate the other. As a gay man whose civil rights have been fought against by Christians, I get your point. But do not let that prevent you from understanding the differences that exist in religions. As an atheist, I have sought to understand and learn more about various religions from more of an academic point of view. When referencing gay people, I hope you do understand the differences within religions as they are expressed in their texts, teachings, demands for compliance and adherence to. To not recognize any difference, is to not be ready to stand up against the discrimination and intolerance that exists in various religions - some of which, are far more dangerous in one religion than another.

Thank you...I understand...I actually do...and I am so very very sorry! This is an important dialog to have...Christians need to understand the reasons for the hatred they have inspired..if we cannot listen to each other calmly, we MUST FIND a way...it IS possible..I am living proof that a person does NOT have to remain a bigot..

Good on you. "I am living proof that a person does NOT have to remain a bigot".
 
Seriously. Good on you.

There is a ton of inexpensive real estate available in the City. Standing on ceremony and putting up a building which 60% of the City is against perhaps should be rethought.

60%?

Yes really, Huffpo article on this subject last week.

I find your argument needs to be rethought. If every moment in history was based on your "thought', nothing in this country would ever change. The majority of people were for slavery, the majority of people were against blacks and whites in schools or being able to marry, the majority of Americans were against allowing Native Americans to become citizens. Over 60% of the people in California voted against allowing same sex marriage. Women "by the majority" said they could not vote, people that were deaf or had other disabilities could not adopt...

 Do you really need any more examples? Overwhelmingly, what you are suggesting is over 60% wrong.

Part of the problem with Arab immigrants is the lack of integration into our Society. The American experiment worked so well throughout our history as the majority of immigrants became proud Americans and part of the Great Society. Today, immigrants come and little effort is made to become American outside of a desire for citizenship. English is not spoken in the home, the Arab children on the whole play with other Arab children.....this is not what America is all about.

There is zero inexpensive real estate in New York City.

TO THE IMAMS AND DEVELOPERS OF THE LOWER MANHATTAN MOSQUE:

 As a politically-independent, practicing-Muslim American, I'd like to say that, should you go ahead as planned with lower Manhattan location, or any other site for that matter, I'm completely for your sensitivity to opponents with a compromise as to make it an ultra-modernist, non-descript architecture with very subtle, non-literal expression of Islam (as if it were an Amanresort on Manhattan) and name such as "Cordoba" instead of "Al-something" without minaret, dome, arabic caligraphy, star and crescent, and broadcast call for prayer, none of which is obligatory anyway for one to be Muslim.

 http://s3.amazonaws.com/sfb111/story_xlimage_2010_05_R6611_WTC_MOSQUE05052010.jpg

 "Cordoba" rightfully conveys the face of American Muslims for peaceful coexistence, tolerance, freedom, and democracy. We, American Muslims, need to show the world our own identity, one that's also distinctively American while not changing the basic, obligatory tennets of Islam and still respecting Arab culture, just not to be confused with Islam that's universal. This should be our way, if many wonder why moderate Muslims don't do a thing about the extremists, to overcome them. Lesson can be learnt from Singapore's, a diverse nation where Muslims are minority, national mosque "Assyafaah".

 http://www.gotarch.com/projects/photo_assyafaah/P1080088_resize_2.jpg

 Again, we can take it up a notch without its minaret (however modernist), star and crescent, Arabic caligraphy, and "Al-something" name. It won't be sinful.

 Cont'd below

Singaporeans wanted to build their mosque in harmony with their nation and its not an Arab nation. Nothing against my Arab brothers and sisters. But many confuse Mideastern traditions and thus some darker sides of it e.g. ninja-type burqa, women's rights or lack thereof, fundamentalist interpretation of Koran, etc. as all Koran and Prophet Mohammed's messages are all about. This distracts those with such misconceptions from the "truth" about Islam and from thriving modernity in Islamic societies e.g. UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey, etc. architecturally, scientifically, educationally, culturally, and religiously that was Cordoba historically and NYC's "Cordoba" and American Muslims have to surpass.

 Many, many Muslims, American or expat, from diverse ethnicities work in many corporations in lower Manhattan. This is not to discount cabbies and others though. Let's also not forget the UN for which lower Manhattan has the obligation to cater to its many Muslim diplomats from many different countries. If DC has the national mosque, its architectural style notwithstanding, catering to Muslim Ambassadors and diplomats among local Muslims, lower Manhattan needs one that represents NYC's modernism and that of American Muslims vis-a-vis the world, American majority, and extremists.

Gov. Paterson, please don't pander to the fear driven protestors, or the haters disguised as patriots.

Did you lose a close friend, or relative in 9-11? Perhaps you would not be fearful, but angry if you had.

Would it make a difference if he/she were angry?

 And by the way, who is NOT angry about 9/11?

 One may be fearful or angry and not be driven by it. To be driven by fear or anger is to be primitive and irrational. To override it is to be civilized.

I am angry, at the extremist, jihadist terrorists. Not to be confused with the religion they seemed to have hijacked along the way. I smelled the pentagon burning from my house. i did have a love one trapped in the chaos and did not know for hours that they were safe. I get angry at extremists of all types. But my ability to see clearly has remained in tact. Thankfully

with that logic then those who attacked on 9/11 have their reasons because they perhaps lost friends and family to american wars and through support of oppressive regimes. so does that make it ok? i think not.

I know many people who were in the buildings that day.
 
I do not know of any who object to the Community Center that will house a Mosque.
 
There are probably some.
