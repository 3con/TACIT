Any Common Ground in the 'Ground Zero Mosque' Debate?
 
  -
  -

That most Americans are fearful of Islam and distrustful of Muslims is not new. Most polls show that 1 in 2 Americans has a negative view of Islam. Thus, it is not surprising that a majority of New Yorkers acting on such perceptions oppose the construction of an Islamic community center and mosque called the Cordoba Center, two blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood. Opponents of the Cordoba Center have often cited the negative public sentiments as a reason why American Muslims should voluntarily give up their right to freedom of religion. That argument was most vocally articulated by the storied and iconic Jewish group Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which opposed the mosque construction saying, "But ultimately this is not a question of rights, but a question of what is right." ADL's leader Abraham Foxman went on to assert that for the victims of 9/11, "Their anguish entitles them to positions that others would categorize as irrational or bigoted."

Supporters of the project have also been full-throated in their support. Jewish Rabbis such as Arthur Waskow and Christian leaders such as Bob Roberts have decried the opposition. However, the most articulate defense came from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In a speech for the ages, Mayor Bloomberg succinctly framed the issue saying:

    Whatever you may think of the proposed mosque and community center, lost in the heat of the debate has been a basic question: Should government attempt to deny private citizens the right to build a house of worship on private property based on their particular religion? That may happen in other countries, but we should never allow it to happen here.

Mayor Bloomberg drew attention to an often-ignored fact:

    Let us not forget that Muslims were among those murdered on 9/11, and that our Muslim neighbors grieved with us as New Yorkers and as Americans. ... Muslims are as much a part of our city and our country as the people of any faith. And they are as welcome to worship in lower Manhattan as any other group. In fact, they have been worshiping at the site for better, the better part of a year, as is their right.

Perhaps the boldest stance was taken by Newsweek and CNN's Fareed Zakaria when he returned an award he had received from ADL in 2005. He urged ADL to reverse its decision and refuted its arguments by rhetorically questioning, "Does Foxman believe that bigotry is OK if people think they're victims? Does the anguish of Palestinians, then, entitle them to be anti-Semitic?" He then went on to mount a practical defense of the Cordoba Center, noting:

    If there is going to be a reformist movement in Islam, it is going to emerge from places like the proposed institute. We should be encouraging groups like the one behind this project, not demonizing them. Were this mosque being built in a foreign city, chances are that the U.S. government would be funding it.

Cordoba Center was intended to bring people together, but unfortunately it is fueling divisiveness. Sponsors of the Cordoba Center were perhaps guilty of "insensitivity," but not for choosing the proposed site, but rather for not better anticipating the sometimes understandable but often contrived opposition. The opponents, on the other hand, may have a few legitimate concerns but are misguided in their opposition. Arguing against the core American value of religious freedom while purporting to protect America makes the opposition irrational and hypocritical.

Now that the Cordoba Center has won its legal right to exist, how can it win the hearts and minds of fellow New Yorkers, at least those who are willing to be fair? How can ADL gain back the moral high ground? Cooler heads must prevail. ADL should withdraw its opposition without giving up its right to ask the Cordoba Center to be sensitive about the pain being felt by so many people of good will. In return, Cordoba Center should also take steps to address legitimate sensitivity.

The Cordoba Center should pledge to not accept any foreign funding. While they have the right to seek donation and support from all legitimate sources, including foreign, it is right to make this institute an all-American effort. In the best traditions of Prophet Muhammad, who allowed a Christian delegation to pray at his mosque, the Cordoba Center could dedicate space for Jewish and Christian prayer services. During the eighth century the Crdoba Mosque in Spain set a good example of religious traditions sharing worship space. Why not recreate such convivencia in New York, where the Statue of Liberty beckons all to freedom?

Some people will never be convinced of the moral legitimacy of Muslims seeking a place of worship in some proximity to Ground Zero. Yet many may change. Giving that moderate center a fair chance rests partly with the organizers of the Cordoba Center. However, putting their vision into practice will also require the support of a broad cross section of civic and religious leaders. Groups like ADL and leaders like Newt Gingrich will serve America better by seeking ways to positively engage with projects like the Cordoba Center. Strident opposition and fear-mongering are not the answer. A vast common ground does exist, a point that the leader of the Cordoba Center, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, evokes in his book What's Right with Islam Is What's Right with America. There is no better way to defeat the morally bankrupt ideology of al-Qaida than to seek that common ground.

Okay, guys. To me the issue here is not just about religious freedom, and honoring the principles that America was founded upon. It's not just about respecting and honoring the victims of 9/11 and their families. To me, for everyone who opposes the cultural center (not mosque) because it is "insensitive" needs to explain why they feel they can equate "terrorist" with "muslim" so easily. To say it is insensitive because it is so close to where muslim terrorists caused the death of thousands implies that the other 1 billion muslims in the world supported and/or were complicit in some way. That is completely prejudiced and offensive. Why don't you ban all people with beards from lower Manhattan? I seem to recall many of the 9/11 terrorists having facial hair. How insensitive for a person with facial hair to walk down there.
 
Islam existed long before 9/11, and to choose to alienate the one billion people who practice it by suggesting that they are not only unwelcome in lower Manhattan but that somehow their mere presence is offensive to the victims of 9/11 is not only nonsensical - it's wrong.

Maybe, just maybe, it had something to do with "Good Muslims" dancing in the street after 9-11?? That is a picture that is hard to forget.

True

source?

The question must be whether or not the benefits in the minds of generous, loving, and thoughtful Muslims, Christians, and Jews is erased by the potential negative actions of a few violent zealots. We would not build an NRA headquarters in the shadow of the former Murrow building not because of what the NRA is, but rather because of what Timothy McVeigh believed about politics. It would offend those whose lives were needlessly sacrificed (even though there is no direct connection). It could give an impression in the mind of the unhinged that McVeigh's actions served some purpose.
 
If one religious wack job considers a Muslim Center a win (or a loss) by placing it at such an emotional site it should not be placed there. There are many places for Mosques and cultural centers. In this case the building's placement is being determined for a political purpose which I personally feel is devoid of common sense.

I am perplexed that David Paterson would suggest state land for the site. Whatever position one stands on the mosque issue, state land must not be used for its site.
 
Once again the incompetent Paterson proves he can not govern. But, then again Paterson could never really govern. ??The Democratic Conference: Organizational and Operational Structure Report?? is an eyewitness account of Paterson??s DYSFUNCTIONAL governing nature while Senate Minority Leader.
 
http://www.politico.com/static/PPM110_demreportfinal.html
 
Paterson??s office was criticized for PATRONAGE, LACK OF LEADERSHIP, INDECISIVENESS and INFIGHTING. Those interviewed in the report indicated that its chief of staff the disorganized Michael Jones-Bey had no management skills, and should be relieved of his duties.
 
Amazingly, for running such a DYSFUNCTIONAL CHAOTIC office, the disorganized Michael Jones-Bey was picked by Paterson to mismanage the Division of Minority & Women Owned Business Development (MWBE) at Empire State Development Corporation.
 
Now, that's the Paterson way, being rewarded for your incompetence.

I work with Muslims, I play sports with Muslims, I even follow the professional lives of Muslims who interest me. I am not anti-Islamic. However, I also don't want a mosque built within 500ft of the greatest mass murder in US history. It just doesn't sit right with me. I have no problem with it being built. There is currently 57 million square feet of real estate available in Manhattan alone. Couldn't they have looked at multiple sites and they gotten community input as part of their selection criteria? Also, why lower Manhattan? It almost exclusively commericial in this area. Hardly any Muslims live there at all. Why not build this mosque in Brooklyn where most Muslims reside? They would appreciate being able to mingle and socalize close to thier homes. Now they have to deal with the inconvenience of traveling all the way to lower Manhattan for services. Just doesn't make much sense to me.

 They can build it where they want. I agree. But if they do, I will see it as completely inconsiderate of the feelings of millions of people. I won't see it as an expression of religious freedom. To increase trust and decrease fear among Americans, they should have considered these feelings when they were researching their location. The leaders of this effort know the world wide impact a 100 story Islamic Center will have in the shadows of the new Freedom Towers. Fear and loathing? Who is exactly at fault. You choose.

The builders need to raise 100 million that they don't have and are supposedly going to raise by donations, what better way to raise your profile than to build the biggest mosque in America by ground zero.
 
They have all the angles covered;
1. building a place "for interfaith baloney"
2. our faith has been attacked, lets build a big mosque
3. etc

The attacks of 9/11 were born of ignorance and fear.

 The cultural center is an attempt to teach understanding and cooperation. If anything, it's exactly the kind of memorial to 9/11 that ought to be there.

Will you jump off the top of it if you are wrong? You are pretty sure of yourself, do YOU live in NY, or do you just lke seeing OTHERS pay for your "tolerance" toward those who hate you?
 No one needs to have the gov. or anyone step an inch over the line drawn by the constitution; we just need to make sure that the Cordoba people also do not step an inch over legal and constitutional lines. Got a Problem with that?
 http://hereticscrusade.com

Its not a memorial to 9/11, its 13 story mosque with a swimming pool

Personally, I would welcome a secular or humanist community center near Ground Zero, where all people from different cultures and backgrounds, including both the religious and non-religious, would be welcomed and accepted.

Maybe you should buy property in downtown Manhattan, then you can do with it what you please.

Is Islam a religion per se or lot more than that. Read their own admission.
 
" Dr. Muhammad al Alkhuli, a popular Islamic scholar, says: "Islam is a religion, but not in the western meaning of religion. The western connotation of the term "religion" is something between the believer and God. Islam as a religion organizes all aspects of life on both the individual and national levels. Islam organizes your relations with God, with yourself, with your children, with your relatives, with your neighbor, with your guest, and with other brethren. Islam clearly establishes your duties and rights in all those relationships. Islam establishes a clear system of worship, civil rights, laws of marriage and divorce, laws of inheritance, code of behavior, what not to drink, what to wear, and what not to wear, how to worship God, how to govern, the laws of war and peace, when to go to war, when to make peace, the law of economics, and the laws of buying and selling. Islam is a complete code of life."
 
It is a complete system and it can not come under First Amendment as a religion.

So, those who claim Christianity as a way of life aren't practicing religion?
 
Get over it. Islam IS a religion, whether you like it or not.

Yes, it is a religion, and it needs to be treated as one, just like Christianity.
 I bet a few years before 9/121 you were absolutely PASSIONATE about holding Christians and their churches to the letter of the Constitutional law and making sure that all priviledges they held were shared by all other religions with no double-standards... I was too, but you apparently never added a day's knowledge to your mind and fail to see that Muslims in the US are pushing for the regrowth of biases and inequities in THEIR favor that we have spent the last 60 years slowly taking away from Christians!
 Justy what is a good thing about this retreat from secular government in favor of things like building foot baths for Muslims at State run colleges while enforcing religious censorship on free speech?
 http://hereticscrusade.com

I'm pretty sure that Islam is a religion. If you have any belief in the supernatural, chances are that you're following the teachings of a religion.

As long as anti Islamic think tanks, political heavy weights are casting dispersions against Muslims and Islam; anti Islamic groups are making loads of money by holding rallies and speeches, fattening their wallets and adding to the anti Islam crazed. The recently advocated by one of the biggest hate groups that Americans should begin killing Muslims. These and many more articles of hate will play into the hands of the insurgents who have said that the non Muslim American people and their invading armies are the same. The significance of this is that non combat personnel suppose to be off limits in war (the shari'ah law), and the admission that these groups speak for the American people. Now, many of these insurgents will begin in earnest to kill any American. This kind of hate and incendiary comments must cease and desist in order to cool down the tensions between American forces and the insurgents. A united front with mosques being assisted instead by firebombed would go alone way in cooling down the heated conflict. Any mosque build on American soil is a reminder that all faiths are welcomed, any opposition reminds the insurgent that American's promise is not to keep and should be invaded.

"The recently advocated by one of the biggest hate groups that Americans should begin killing Muslims."
 
Really? Could you please be more specific about this outlandish charge? Which hate group? Which death threats?
 
And mosques firebombed? Where did that occur, exactly?
 
"Any mosque build on American soil is a reminder that all faiths are welcomed, any opposition reminds the insurgent that American's promise is not to keep and should be invaded."
 
Ok, so if Americans don't agree that a mosque should be built at a certain location, we should kowtow to Moslems so that we don't get invaded? No way, Jose. We have a right to protest if we disagree with something. The right to protest is just as legal as your right to build a mosque.
 
Bring it on. Invade away.

SIOA Co-Founder: Kill Your Liberal Relatives and All Muslims, his name is John Joseph Jay, read up on it! And, since 2007, the frequencies of mosque fire bombings have occurred in Florida, Ohio, California and other states, check CAIR reports on this topic. And, the insurgents are talking about their overall policies of invasions of Muslim lands, killing by drone attacks and murder of innocent Afghans and Iraqis. Also, the history has shown that American has been quick to offer a treaty that they don't fulfill. Asked the American Indians! Ask the African Americans! And ask the Mujahideen and Afghan Arabs after the soviet war, they the US promise all these these groups and many more? Yes they did! Did they fulfill their promise? No, they did not! Afghan Arabs became the Al Qaeda and Mujahideen became the Taliban. And, when you read the comment on insurgents who speak in Arabic on many Arabic channels, they talk of these things; read my post again and don't attribute that I advocating invading anyone or any country. You are so tied up in your hate and anger that someone who comment on Islam that is not bashing it, and I usually get these kind of responses. As though they have the right to bash Islam and I have no right to defend it.

The New York Times has an article today http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/nyregion/11mosque.html?hp , which mentions, almost off-handedly, the specific religious traditions of those building the mosque. It's Sufi. To make a long story short, the al-Queda, Salafist Islamist types hate and persecute Sufis because they are intolerant fundamentalists and the Sufis are not. The Saudi Wahhabis don't like Sufism, and the feeling is mutual. Not much chance the Saudis are going to fund this place, which means they're not too likely to have the kind of radical terrorist-sympathizing religious leaders other Saudi-funded mosques are known for.

"Cordoba Center was intended to bring people together, but unfortunately it is fueling divisiveness."
 
No. What's fueling the divisiveness are the folks trying to stop it. Whether they h@te Muslims, whether they have trouble telling the difference between a terro.rist and a religion, whether their grief is so great that 10 years later they feel justified in denying others' their rights, whether whatever un-American reason they can concoct - none of them wash.

The threat of jarring and destructive schisms in society is worthy of serious discussion when it comes to Islam in Western cultures. One need only look to Europe and the Middle East for instruction. The social problems there cannot be ascribed to Islamophobia.
 
One of the most intelligent and informed discussions of the issue is here:
 
http://article.nationalreview.com/438941/ban-the-burqa/claire-berlinski

I can see why Mr. Ahmed is a recognized scholar, because his rhetoric is subtle. But beneath the polished veneer of reasonableness and erudition lurks the same unpersuasive arguments in favor of the proposed Cordoba center:
 
1. Those opposing the center are bigoted.
 
2. Muslims also perished at Ground Zero on 9/11. This is a specious reference, and no one has been able to explain satisfactorily because some Muslims perished, the proposed mosque is justified. Look at it this way, what if only Muslims had perished on 9/11? Would that somehow make the proposed mosque less arrogant and ill-advised? Just the opposite, I think.
 
3. Mr. Ahmed implies that opponents want to prohibit the mosque. I don't think that is being argued seriously by anyone. We all understand that the developers have the legal right to build the mosque. Instead opposition is more in the form of lectures and advice--the site selection is wrong, disrespectful. It should be remembered that in the USA, opponents have the right to protest. And the protest may last a long time if the development proceeds.
 
And so on, right down to citing Fareed Zakaria's John Kerry-like return of the award.
 
I thank Mr. Ahmed for suggesting no foreign funds should be used on this project. If this is followed through, the mosque won't be built on the proposed site. Time will tell.

"3. Mr. Ahmed implies that opponents want to prohibit the mosque. I don't think that is being argued seriously by anyone. We all understand that the developers have the legal right to build the mosque. Instead opposition is more in the form of lectures and advice--the site selection is wrong, disrespectful. "
 
Then why are there protests all across the country to mosques being built? There is no 9-11 sites in Tennessee, Wisconsin or California. The 9-11 site is a red-herring.

Tolerance of diversity is our law. So is tolerance of lawful opposition. Moslems have a right to build mosques. Those who oppose the mosques have a legal right to protest.
 
Welcome to America. Deal with it.

Forswearing foreign funding would be a positive gesture. What would practically be even more helpful and perhaps necessary if the first occurred is to scale down the project to a building about the size of the current Burlington Coat Factory. Let's be realistic and think long-term, people and demonstrating groups will be visiting Ground Zero from now on. If they can see minarets a couple blocks away while doing so, that's going to be a permanent red flag being waved in front of enraged bulls (and I don't mean the Wall St. kind). A smaller place not visible from Ground Zero will get much less attention. Out of sight, out of mind.

 What might be even better than that is to work on Governor Patterson's recent suggestion and swap properties to put the mosque a bit further away from the line of fire, say a couple blocks east, which probably would be better for actual Muslims working in the area. To be flippant for a moment, given Mayor Bloomberg's fierce advocacy of the project, maybe part of City Hall Park would be a good place to put it.:)

Perfect. Oh, and while we're at it, we can reduce the size of St. Patrick's Cathedral to about the same size, since those Irish Catholics are, well, you know, trying to take over and push their heathen Catholic beliefs on the rest of us -- oh, wait, that was 100 years ago... Explain to me why the size of the building matters so much. I think that many devout people, regardless of their beliefs, want a glorious monument to their God's glory.

the Catholics are too busy rap.ing little boys

Building a mosque at Ground Zero is equivalent to permitting a Serbian Orthodox church near the killing fields of Srebrenica where 8,000 Muslim men and boys were slaughtered.
When cloistered nuns tried to establish a convent at Auschwitz the world called it inappropriate and the religious community abandoned the site.
There are many questions that should be answered first. Questions about where the funding is coming from? If this mosque is being funded by Saudi sources, then it is an even bigger slap in the face of Americans, as nine of the jihadis in the Twin Tower calamity were Saudis.
If Iman Rauf is serious about building bridges, then he could have dedicated space in this so-called community center to a church and synagogue, but he did not. He could have proposed a memorial to the 9/11 dead with a denouncement of the doctrine of armed jihad, but he chose not to.
I haven't forgotten seeing the images of horror on 9/11and I am still frozen in my horror. While the attacks were denounced by the governments of countries traditionally considered hostile to the United States, such as Cuba, Iran, Libya and North Korea, there is plenty of footage of Palestinians celebrating in the streets-so please don't try to play that card. Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf's statement
in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, that "United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened." This is not a just a religious freedom issue.

Ironically, the most "brainwashed, undereducated" elements in society, that embrace all the fallacies of the leading tenets and doctrines, are making an uproar of settled constitutional question: "the right to freedom of religious expression", it is immutable. It would be unconstitutional to impede on the rights of Americans to worship as they choose, even if there are those that disagree with their beliefs. Furthermore, its shockening that a nation, especially the capitalist capitol of the globe is concerned at all with the building of a rather insignificant mosque, on an understandably controversial site, when the "real" Temple of Worship for western society, is neither the Vatican, Mecca etc., in NYC of all the places on the planet, the real worship is of MONEY. Yes, these misguided rebels would impede on the rights of citizens to pray as they may, but they stand in worship of the corrupted brethren of of the "high finance priesthood." Still, it matters very little if they move Mecca or the Vatican to the 9/11 site, because on the day of recknowing, and the rise of Aquarious, the false profits and the "scion of the money changers" are going to be eradicated and those "horsemen" are going to divide the world between the humble believers in "The One" and the blasphemous, who soak is cloak in blood and tyranny, while expostulating in his mighty name, but he does not dwelleth in their heart.

 America, is this the best that we can do?

It is also unreasonable to expect that opponents to the mosque should holster their own constitutional right to peacefully speak and assemble to express their opposition.

Furthermore, it is not the "brainwashed, undereducated" elements in society protesting this ill-advised project. Quite the opposite.

Sir or Madam,"Atlas Shrugged" avatar. Ironically, the most "brainwashed, undereducated" elements in society, that embrace all the fallacies of the leading tenets and doctrines, obviously will be represented by those who ARE aware of the powers of the Patriot Act. That will put short end to both the constitutional question and your belief that ~" it is immutable". Foreign monies from terrorist backed regimes that may possibly fund this endeavor will be scrutinized because transparency of the funding will become a daily watch. So expostulate and keep a watch for your "vampires cloaked in blood" but ACLJ will preveal. So in a way you are correct~it is all about the money.
