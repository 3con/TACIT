GOP Charge: Ground Zero Mosque is bin Laden's Trojan Horse
 
  -
  -

Don't look now but the mosque at Ground Zero is the Trojan horse that Osama bin Laden has been dreaming of in his cave somewhere in the Hindu Kush. Gary Berntsen, the tough-as-nails former CIA operative running to unseat Senator Chuck Schumer in New York, tells me al Qaeda and its affiliates are set to infiltrate the mosque before it has been built.

"This is not about religious freedom: it is a beachhead by foreign elements cloaked in a religious institution," Berntsen said in reply to my question as to whether he thinks the U.S. Constitution protects the would-be mosque in any way. He sounded dire in his predictions: "They will succeed in opening it, shielding themselves with our Constitution and it will become a magnet for militancy.  It will be a proud outpost for militancy steps away from Ground Zero."

Berntsen earlier told a New York newspaper, the Albany Times-Union, that al Qaeda would try to infiltrate the mosque and that it should be built somewhere else -- a block or two away -- but not within "eyesight" of Ground Zero.

Berntsen, a decorated public servant who ran our spy agency's failed attempt to capture Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora from his base at Bagram Air Field in 2001, told me that the current head of the mosque project Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf has "associations" with an Iranian diplomat formerly posted in New York who is "suspected in the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction."

He also blasted Rauf for what he said were his ties to the Turkish humanitarian mission to Gaza whose boat the Israeli military boarded in late May in a bloody showdown. Berntsen's allegations are unproven and possibly reckless. Fareed Zakaria -- who vowed to return a $10,000 award from a leading mosque opponent, the Anti Defamation League (A.D.L.,) over the weekend - says Imam Rauf offers an interpretation of Islam that most Americans can admire. He insists that Rauf sees America as a "peaceful, tolerant and pluralistic state."

In 2001, Rauf, an American citizen, condemned the attacks on the World Trade Center, but added in a 60 Minutes interview that the U.S. was "an accessory to the crime that happened" because "we have been (an) accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world."

Berntsen's said the mosque would "provide cover for hundreds of young men not normally in the downtown Manhattan area -- just to hang out."

But the legal barriers to stopping the mosque, which has already gained local government approval, are formidable. The First Amendment of the Constitution states that U.S. government "shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..." The same amendment also protects the right of free assembly.

Indeed, Americans who value their freedom should listen closely to the echoes of fear resounding from coast to coast this summer. I recall hearing similar warnings about the "other" falling from the lips of the notorious Slobodan Milosevic in the Balkans in the 1990s.

On Monday morning on the MSNBC cable station, New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino said in an interview that "Cordoba" means "triumph and conquest."

Berntsen is wrong to stoke fear, but Paladino's blind critique of "Cordoba" turns history upside down. Compared to Moorish Spain in the 9th and 10th Centuries A.D., Charlemagne's European experiment was an abysmal failure driven by greed and warmongering crusaders.

In Europe's darkest days, Christian Visigoths decreed that "The King will tolerate no one in his kingdom who is not Catholic." By contrast, in Andalusian Spain, ancient Islam outpaced Christianity in the fields of mathematics, science, and writing. Andalusian Jews, inhabitants of the peninsula since well-before the time of Christ, welcomed and prospered in the early years of the Moorish conquest. Compared to the later years of the Catholic-led Spanish Inquisition, which banned Judaism and Islam outright, they breathed easy and lived well.

An expansion of the Andalusian Islamic empire in Europe began during the rule of the Cordoban Caliph Abd al-Rahman. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed son of Prince Mohammad and a Frankish slave ascended the throne at the age of twenty-two in 912 A.D.. He ruled for a half-century marked by prosperity and religious freedom - in an era when forced conversion was virtually unheard of.

Historians still marvel at the emphasis placed by the Andalusian Caliphate on the need for public education. Cordoba's seventy libraries had nothing of comparative size or value anywhere in the western world. The main library alone had some 400,000 volumes. By comparison, a leading abbey in Switzerland, which boasted one of the most literate communities of monks in Europe, had a mere six hundred books.

Andalusian Spain was far more than a footnote in European history: Its scholarship and economic success helped spark the Renaissance.

Berntsen is an admirable character who lambasted George W. Bush for not nailing Osama bin Laden when he had the chance at Tora Bora, but he has presented no "smoking gun" of any al Qaeda ties or interests in the Ground Zero mosque. He says that "They (Islamic extremists) are using the West's respect and tolerance for all religions against us."

It is appropriate, however, to ask whether the views of mosque opponents like Berntsen and Paladino can be said to embody the "tolerance" that sets this nation apart from all others.

Given that this is an election year it is quite apparent that fear mongering tea party activism is being presented at its greatest. Appreciate the history lesson, as it seems all too often that we are not in tune with the past from which we crawled out of. I cannot substantiate this claim, but believe that every religion has conducted offenses against other religions or beliefs in a manner we would consider unacceptable by today's standards. To think that we still have not figured out how to be truly tolerant, instead spend our time fear mongering and misrepresenting history.

I'm always facinated by the implication that these radicals are always so much smarter than our own people who have made carreers at reasonably thwarting their efforts here at home. If they are infiltrating the Mosque before it is even built, I have to believe our intelligence forces are doing the same and will have a great inside vantage point to ensure nothing untowardly happens. If not, we are we spending untold billions on National Security?

Just how far away does a building have to be from the original WTC towers before the media will stop saying that it's "at ground zero"? A five-minute walk? A ten-minute walk? Too far to walk in your lunch hour?
 
The proposed Muslim community center is not "at ground Zero"; it is TWO BLOCKS AWAY:
 
http://indyposted.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Mosque-Near-Ground-Zero1.jpg
 
It seems to me that the anti-Muslim faction is simpy trying to declare most of lower Manhattan a "Muslims not welcome" zone using 9/11 as an excuse. The media framing this as a building "at ground zero" is rather misleading, IMO.

"Compared to Moorish Spain in the 9th and 10th Centuries A.D., Charlemagne's European experiment was an abysmal failure driven by greed and warmongering crusaders."
 
And yet, Mr. Smucker, Western Europe managed to establish a string of democratic states, while the seed culture of the Caliphate did not.
 
Dumb Luck, eh?

Correct Stephen. I believe that you likely include Spain in "Western Europe," however, and also acknowledge the impact of Moorish Spain on the future European Renaissance. I'm not sure we are far apart on that front. I would refer you to Whatley's piece as to whether we "Judeo-Christians" have any monopoly or original claim to "democracy," I believe the Greeks and Romans preceded us in that regard.

phsst...all GOPers running for election I will really tell you what is going on, all 1.5 billion of us Muslims had gotten together at a meeting in DC to decide how to infiltrate and take over the US government.

 It was decided that those who where the white amongst us would join the Republican party and run for election. It was even said that they could smear Islam if it ment that they would get
 elected. We got the idea from the Troy story, you know the horse thingy

 Now I don't want to betray my fellow Muslims but I love the US... Sharon Angle.

The GOP isn't going to tell you that the Muslim community has been meeting regularly in the WTC area for years ... or that they're Americans.
 
See http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/nyregion/11mosque.html?hp

What a glowing post on Islamic relations in Cordoba, see how awesome they were, they had a big library, and it was the Christians who were intolerant. Maybe if more of the story was told, it would add some perspective.
 
After all, you could say that Germans and Jews lived together in harmony for many years, and point out the many examples of how industrious the German people are. But that would not really be telling the story of Germany from 1919 to 1945, would it?
 
48 Christians of Crdoba were decapitated for religious offences against Islam. These deaths played out, not in a single spasm of religious unrest, but over an extended period of time;
 
During these successive waves of violence against non-Muslims, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the then-still relatively tolerant city of Toledo, which had been reconquered in 1085 by Christian forces.
 
The Almohads, who had taken control by 1147, far surpassed the Almoravides in fundamentalist outlook, and they treated the dhimmis harshly. Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, many Jews and Christians emigrated.
 
Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from Al-Andalus to ravage the Christian Spanish and Portuguese kingdoms, In raid against Lisbon in 1189, for example, the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur took 3,000 female and child captives, while his governor of Crdoba, in a subsequent attack upon Silves in 1191, took 3,000 Christian slaves.

Now that you have made the Muslims out to be as bad as the Nazis, would you like to go after the Catholics who ran the Inquisition? My point is not to tell the complete history -- for that you can read volume after volume of conflicting accounts. Rather, I'm pointing out that Andalusia does not have the history many Christians and politicians would have us believe. If you don't see that, so be it, but don't try to convince us that the Visigoths or the Catholics (later) were decent and kind to others of opposing religions. There is enough intollerance to go around, my brother.

HAHA..that was a funny blog Phillip.
 
Enemies of the state don't refuge and plan their next attack in the most obvious place they can be. I am sure that a muslim community centre in seattle would be a better place, less security, a more isolated muslim population and a more tolerant city.
but what do we know, i am sure Berntsen knows everything there is to know about how to capture Al Qaeda members that we have to take his wise word for it, Lame attempt!
 
some people love to stereotype and categories others, it makes them more comfortable, but if you do that to them, they will be furious.
 
Here is one.... ALL Tea Party members are a bunch of CRAZY, WHITE, ULTRA CONSERVATIVE, CHRISTIAN.....they should not be intitled to their opinions....true?!
NOT TRUE!

It's also impressive to note the GOP has knowledge of the Trojan War, what with it happening nowhere near USC and all...

The only terrorists I see,
Masquerade as the GOP.

"I'm really starting to question the basic sanity of the American public."-Phil Ochs

Probable but not yet proven:
 Bin Laden is dead and has been since the early days of the war on terror but BushCheney had announced his death the public would have demanded they bring our boys and girls home, or

 Bin Laden is alive and has been living in protective luxury somewhere other than the Afghanistan-Pakistan hinterlands since we stood around and watched the Pakistani air force airlift him from the Bagram air field before we captured it.

 Also, why is no one discussing the Islamic symbol memorializing the crash of Flight 93?

well, this could be true if you look at the success of Southern Baptist churches in the South. Slowly but surely over several decades they entrenched themselves into the Southern cutlure and politics so that in the 1950's there were able to flex their political muscles and greatly influence local and regional politics. But, I highly doubt Islam will be able to do so for at least several generations. They don't have the demographics that the SBC started with.

Since the 1950's Southern Baptists were overwhelmingly Southerners who lived in the South, they had no need to infiltrate or entrench themselves into the goings-on down there, since there were there already-- since birth. As there are nothing like their number of Muslims anywhere in the US now, and as I imagine conversion is off since 9-11, there is simply no chance that Muslims would ever find themselves in a comparable position of influence.

The SB have tried many times to pass laws that fail the Constitutional test, and they always get thrown out. Sharia law that fails the Constitutional test would also be thrown out.

I thought Bernsten was unhinged, even when he was ripping George W. Something seemed manic and "off" about him.
 
I suppose being in the CIA and doing what he did will change one's temperament, but that doesn't make one a good fit for elected office.

I sure hope Oklahoma City took out all those "trojan horse" Christian Churches in their city.

 We have no idea when the perpetrators of 4/19/1995 may strike again.
