 Stuart Whatley: Democratic Values, Islam and the Judeo-Christian Tradition
 Fallacy Models for pluralistic societies based on liberal democratic values
 exist throughout the historical landscape, independent of the
 Judeo-Christian tradition. It bodes well that they may be freely adopted by
 all cultures.
 Stephan Salisbury: Extremism at Ground Zero (Again) The mosque controversy
 is not really about a mosque at all; it's about the presence of Muslims in
 America, and the free-floating anxiety and fear that now dominate the
 nation's psyche.
 Sally Steenland: Correcting the Distorted Lens of Islamophobia We need to
 be more informed about Islam and its followers and push back against hate
 speech and fear-based rhetoric that lumps one of the world's greatest and
 most diverse faiths into a monolithic block.
 Dean Obeidallah: Why Building the Mosque is Good for America! Where can the
 Muslim community center be built in NYC? I say you can build it here or
 there, by a house or a mouse, in Tribeca by Robert DeNiro or further down
 by Ground Zero. It's that simple.
 Zahra Khan: The Potpourri Resolution for a Ground Zero Mosque Adherents to
 Islam form a vulnerable racial minority before a prejudiced media that uses
 religious misnomers like "Islamic terrorist" to develop public support for
 attacking adherents to Islam, a word that literally means "Peace."
 Dr. David P. Gushee: The Shameful Mosque Controversy A longstanding effort
 to build a Muslim center that ended up being near what became "Ground Zero"
 has become Exhibit A in the contest between popular passion and
 constitutional principle.

Con Ed is a utility company. They have no business doing anything to support or block this community center. As the buildings owners they need to stay within the law. People act like all of a sudden the Muslims showed up. They have been there since before 9/11 and now want to improve their building.
 
The hatred I see toward a whole lot of people for the acts of a very few, shows me how weak the U.S. is in spirit and how the terrorists really did achieve exactly what they wanted. The attacks claimed to be because America's continued meddling in other countries, now, day after day we show them our bigotry.
 
Sad

This gives the opponents of teh Victory Mosque an opportunity to buy the real property from Con Ed.
 
As a publicly traded company Con Ed is are under a legal obligation to maximize profits for their shareholders. By law they HAVE TO sell to the highest bidder. What the opponents need to do is out-bid the Islamics. End of problem!
 
Furthermore, the fact that Con Ed owns this property presents an opportunity for Con Ed shareholders to institute Shareholder Derivative Actions to make sure that Con Ed sells to the right buyer. That will take years to resolve, especially after 3 layers of available appeals. In the meantime, the Islamics who feel that they NEED this mosque can go find someplace else less controversial and confrontational to build it.

Like the Ports Authority sold the WTC to the er. 'highest bidder', one Larry Silverstein?

Did you actually READ the whole story? The one in the link? It says, in part, that ConEd has no authority over what happens on the site and that the lease runs until 2071. Until that lease runs out or is bought out -- ConEd cannot sell that property.

The building is closer to City Hall than it is to Ground Zero. The vast majority of people who will be visiting the Memorial and the new Freedom Tower won't be exploring the side streets north of Church Street. Unless I'm mistaken, the main intent of the bulding is to be a community center for Muslims, along with a prayer room. This is not going to be a "mosque", so why does Huffington Post keep repeating that it is?

The site of the building is 400 feet from Ground Zero. City Hall is farther away, but not by much.

HP is right. It IS a mosque, (a Victory Mosque), with a community center in it. All to serve a community that is barely residential to begin with.
