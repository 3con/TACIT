Greg Gutfield, author and wit, in the spirit of cultural understanding and learning is organizing a campaign to open a Muslim gay bar next door to Park51, the mosque proposed near Ground Zero.

From his website:

"So, the Muslim investors championing the construction of the new mosque near Ground Zero claim it's all about strengthening the relationship between the Muslim and non-Muslim world.

As an American, I believe they have every right to build the mosque - after all, if they buy the land and they follow the law - who can stop them?

Which is, why, in the spirit of outreach, I've decided to do the same thing.

I'm announcing tonight, that I am planning to build and open the first gay bar that caters not only to the west, but also Islamic gay men. To best express my sincere desire for dialogue, the bar will be situated next to the mosque Park51, in an available commercial space.

This is not a joke. I've already spoken to a number of investors, who have pledged their support in this bipartisan bid for understanding and tolerance.

As you know, the Muslim faith doesn't look kindly upon homosexuality, which is why I'm building this bar. It is an effort to break down barriers and reduce deadly homophobia in the Islamic world.

The goal, however, is not simply to open a typical gay bar, but one friendly to men of Islamic faith. An entire floor, for example, will feature non-alcoholic drinks, since booze is forbidden by the faith. The bar will be open all day and night, to accommodate men who would rather keep their sexuality under wraps - but still want to dance.

Bottom line: I hope that the mosque owners will be as open to the bar, as I am to the new mosque. After all, the belief driving them to open up their center near Ground Zero, is no different than mine.

My place, however, will have better music.

The worst offenders on homophobia right now are Islam and some of those pentacostal sects that set up shop in African countries.

Radical Islam?

radical christian lunatics and more "tolerant" ones around here? It is pretty tough to find any sort of admittance around here that there is any kind of faith that isn't foaming at the mouth a la Sarah Palin. is there an "Islam" that loves "the gay"?

from me, especially when it comes to Gnosticism. I am capable of separating the radical-fanatical garbage from the real faith. You'll see the same duality in all faiths. Every faith has its artificial vs. organic nature. Most people are unable to make the distinction, unfortunately. "Artificial faith" is like plastic. It is harmful to the environment. True faith however is organic thus tolerant to environment(biodegreable)...

I am talking about whatever you want to call the form that predominates from North Africa through the Middle East and Iran/Afghanistan.

Check out this chart. It is clear where some of the worst offenders (ie homosexuality punishable by imprisonment or death) are concentrated

http://en.wikipedia.org/...

There are, of course, complex interplays of religion, culture, tradition, and authoritarian regimes at work.

Here it is again

Islam is more virulent in its hatred of than the contemporary Catholic church.

The worst offenders on homophobia right now are Islam and some of those pentacostal sects that set up shop in African countries.

That pretty much covers your Uganda example.

- ()
Your heading should say "Christianity is more virulent in its hatred of gays", and as an example cite the pentecostals in Uganda.
 
The way you wrote makes it sound like the Pentecostals are a sect of muslims.

I don't know where you can possibly get what you claim from that.

Furthermore, in a four line comment, one should read more than the title.

those aren't the muslims living in downtown Manhattan though. They aren't even driving around to different towns with signs saying "God hates fags".

church in NYC, certain within a block they're has to be one. I'll look for the rainbow flag next time I'm walking around and pass a church.

But to your point, their ought to be, and it really is no different.

but it sucks that when a group is the victim of something like blind or irrational intolerance the obvious answer is to somehow flip the table and try to expose some intolerance on their part. It's like the assholes in cali that wanted to bring dogs by muslims.

against gays on the part of American Muslims as the LDS church, I'll be rather surprised...

think they wouldn't be just as anti-gay if they were on the same footing as LDS or the Catholic Church? While it is obviously deplorable that Muslims are viewed with suspicion in this country, and that they feel like they are less free to express themselves (and plenty of people make them feel that way), don't you think they'd be just as anti-gay as other churches if they had the chance.

in that there is no muslim-centric gay bar and no mosque by the WTC site yet.

I felt like I had no dog in the fight over the mosque, and I feel like the gay bar "joke" is actually meant to tweak non-muslim people into saying "hey that's offensive to muslims".

or the diarist have evidence the Cordoba folks are actively engaging in anti-gay activities?

Specifically, do they have evidence that the Cordoba project has contributed money to anti-gay ballot initiatives, sponsored such initiatives, and created phone banks to support such initiatives?

No?

So what was the point of this exercise again?

and buy the property and manage to keep it open after no one walks into your little spite project, and sure, you're free to it.

Seriously who is Greg Gutfield and why should we care what his juvenile fantasies are?

someone please explain this to me: What makes a bar a 'gay bar'? Isn't it just a bar that has a reputation for being friendly towards LGBT patrons? Perhaps it's located in Provincetown or in another gay-friendly community. I don't think a bar can prohibit customers from entering based on race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. True, if a man and a woman walk into Stonewall... sorry, that sounds like the beginning of a bad joke. My point is, I think Gutfield isn't as serious as he says he is. You can't put a sign saying 'Gay Bar, No Straights Allowed' outside of an establishment.

,

It is nothing nefarious, but bars do tend to self-segregate by sexual orientation. Some are known as gay bars and some aren't.

Since many people who go to bars want to either

1) hit on people of the sex they are attracted to

or

2) not get hit on by members of the sex they aren't attracted to

bars just tend to differentiate into gay and straight in this way.

I think I'll go there to pick up girls... just to annoy Greg Gutfield :-)

Did Gutfield say anything about when he is going to open a Christian gay bar and a Jewish gay bar? What a fun place the area will turn out to be...

Tolerance goes all ways. And it should. Especially in New York City, the world's great melting pot.

100 gay bars if you want, more power to you. if you think you can offend Muslims by doing that you have a pretty small mind. it is your money feel free to do whatever you want with it, after all this is a free country or so wish us to believe. and by the way you can bring dogs too because god knows Muslims hate dogs, another faux news myth.

by a gay bar, no? Just like many born again Chirstians, orthodox Jews, or hard core Hindus?

- ()
...project belongs to hard core "orthodox" Muslims. On the contrary they sound liberal. I honestly don't think they would give a darn even if there were 10 Muslim gay bars next door...
 
Is it o.k. to open gay bars next to Churches and Synagogues? I am curious...
 
This is rather funny stuff

The comment I was responding to said this

if you think you can offend Muslims by doing that you have a pretty small mind.

No reference to Cordoba. It was, rather, making the claim that 'muslims' could not be offended by homosexuality, which obviously can't be true of all muslims, which is what I was pointing out.

And finally, yes, of course it is ok to open gay bars next to other houses of worship, especially in New York City.

What is with people not actually reading comments in context today?

around here? They're the most homophobic bunch on television.

but apparently, there is a bit of a phenomena in certain Middle East countries, like, Iraq, and the Muslim culture ... it's called "Gay Thursday" .... you see, as I understand it .... since they can't have sex with women on Thursday nights, because Friday is, hmmm, a holy day, or something .... sooooo .... apparently, many men are basically Gay on Thursday ... yeah, they go around "playing" with each other, but only on Thursdays ... but if you try to do that same thing, on, say, Saturday or Sunday or Monday, they will not be pleased and will probably kill you.

Hmmm ... I wonder if crossing the international date-line will help you if you're a guy and happen to hit on another guy on a Friday and they responded in a negative manner? Just askin ....
