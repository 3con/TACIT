- David Boies crushes Tony Perkins on Face The Nation:
"In a court of law you've got to come in and you've got to support those opinions, you've got to stand up under oath and cross-examination," Boies said. "And what we saw at trial is that it's very easy for the people who want to deprive gay and lesbian citizens of the right to vote [sic] to make all sorts of statements and campaign literature, or in debates where they can't be cross-examined.
 
"But when they come into court and they have to support those opinions and they have to defend those opinions under oath and cross-examination, those opinions just melt away. And that's what happened here. There simply wasn't any evidence, there weren't any of those studies. There weren't any empirical studies. That's just made up. That's junk science. It's easy to say that on television. But a witness stand is a lonely place to lie. And when you come into court you can't do that.
 
"That's what we proved: We put fear and prejudice on trial, and fear and prejudice lost," Boies said.

I don't care if Obama personally kisses the ass of every liberal in the nation. We were there when he needed us to get elected and now he and Gibbs and Rahm, et.al., just see us as an annoyance to swat away like so many swamp flies in the DC summer humidity. I'm interested in Obama living up to the "liberal" promises he made in order to suck us in and that he and his staff now deny he ever made. Gibbs has his head up his ass if he thinks that the "professional liberals" do not represent the voice of liberal America. We need professionals like Kos and Maddow. THEY are the voice of liberal America and are the only way we "little liberals" can be heard at all.

Ground Zero Mosque Not at Ground Zero and Not a Mosque : Veterans Today

-August 9, 2010 - After 9/11 attacks, islamophobia began to take shape in the collective consciousness of the American and western general public. But for the American Muslims it was a lot more than viewing this antipathy on TV, they were living it, day in and day out.

Human history is replete with disasters brought about by attitudes of arrogance and superiority complex based on race, color, language and religious affiliation.

And the latter has been the example of the latest uproar over what is called Ground Zero mosque in lower Manhattan, New York.

The New York Landmarks Preservation commission on Tuesday denied landmark status to a building near the World Trade Center site, freeing a group to convert the property into an Islamic community center and mosque that has drawn national opposition. Continued

EXCLUSIVE: Coal Barons At Industry Retreat Plot To Indoctrinate Children About Wonders Of Coal

This past weekend, coal company executives convened for the annual West Virginia Coal Association meeting in White Sulphur Springs, WV. The event, which was closed to the public, was held at the lavish Greenbrier Resort, where an overnight stay can cost upwards of $6,000 (plus tax). One panelist at the meeting, state Senate Finance Chairman Walt Helmick, pointed out the exclusivity of the resort hotel: "I used to drive by the Greenbrier often when I was young, but I never had the money to come in because Im a former coal miner."

During the event, over 100 attendees collaborated on issues from hiring industry lobbyists to fighting federal regulations. However, one of the biggest concerns on the minds of coal executives was how to ensure children would be taught an industry-friendly approach to coal issues in the classroom.

During a membership meeting attended by ThinkProgress, attendees took the opportunity to vent about their poor public perception and accused teachers of turning children against them. One coal executive, Jim Bunn, summed up the general sentiment:

 BUNN: Theres so much negativity in the classroom, and I really dont understand that. I can tell you that every industry has negatives throughout. I dont care what it is. The education system has negatives. We need to get them to understand that we are not Darth Vader, we are good people. Were just like you in that we come to work every morning.

West Virginia Senate President Earl Ray Tomblin concurred, saying, "I agree with you that those kind of programs could be expanded" because West Virginia children are being unduly influenced by "what they hear on the national news...on how bad coal is." Coal executives and state legislators continued their mutual admiration for changing the state curriculum to be more pro-industry. A coal executive named Joe proposed the idea of a statewide "Coal Day":

JOE: Theres a West Virginia labor day recognized in public schools. I think something like that could work in the coal context as well. Pick a day of the year that West Virginia public schools would discuss mining, its concept, its history, its contribution to the state of West Virginia. Food for thought.

 STATE SENATE ENERGY, INDUSTRY & MINING CHAIRMAN MIKE GREEN: I remember in the 8th grade getting a lot of information about coal, about the history of coal. Is that still being done?

 UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Actually, its just the opposite. They get taught how bad coal is in our schools.

(AP) New York Gov. David Paterson is offering state help if the developers of a proposed mosque near ground zero agree to move the project farther from the site of the Sept. 11 attacks.

Paterson said Tuesday that he understands the resentment many feel against the plan for an Islamic cultural center a few blocks from ground zero.

The Democrat says that although the project is protected by the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom, New York is still suffering from the attacks. He says some state property elsewhere might be suitable.

He notes that Muslims were among those killed in the 2001 attacks fueled by fanaticism, not the religion as most observe it.

4) The left hasn't been a rebel; it's been too good a soldier. Amazing that the White House would be upset at carping from the Beltway left which has embarrassed itself by its willingness to absorb insult and salute. Women rallied to support a health care bill that weakened choice. Progressives supported the bill despite the president's unwillingness to fight for a public option, the taxes on good (read union) health care plans, and the grotesque deal with drug companies to sustain the ban on Medicare getting bulk price discounts. Environmentalists went so far as to embrace off-shore drilling in the failed effort to get the energy bill. Black leaders like Al Sharpton argued against any targeted economic programs, even as the African-American community was suffering depression levels of misery in the economic collapse. The antiwar movement gave the president a pass on Afghanistan. Gay people have been remarkably patient at delay in repealing the indefensible don't-ask-don't-tell policy. Progressives pushed financial reform hard, even after the Treasury Department helped defeat amendments to break up the big banks and more.

This quote comes from a play called the "The Mourning Bride" written in 1697 by William Congreve. The complete quote is "Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned / Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned."

It basically means that no one is angrier than a woman who has been rejected/cheated/insulted etc. The quote implies that hell would be a far better place for the purpetraitor to be, rather than to face the woman!

All the punishments that you would find or be subjected to in the burning depths of hell would be childs play compared to what scorned woman would do to you! (sounds scary doesn't it!? Makes me glad to be a woman!)

If you're talking to me, why can't I record it? Afraid I'll use your own words against you? Does it matter if I take shorthand, instead?
 
Businesses do it all the time, just by having a recorded disclaimer, "calls may be recorded for quality assurance purposes". If I don't agree, I have to hang up, and presumably never get my issues addressed. I've occasionally thought about doing the same thing on my home line.

days before nattering idiots on their mobiles -- had an aura of privacy about them. Telephones were located at a place, and we didn't think of them as public. In a two-way conversation, it's no great imposition on free speech to tell the other party that you are recording the conversation.
 
In a public place, however...everything changes.
 
If you yammer on into your cell phone about sensitive information while riding on a train, you have no reasonable expectation that your conversation is private.

New York City's transit authority announced its decision Monday to approve a bus ad opposing the proposed mosque near Ground Zero.

The ad, which was paid for by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, is the latest evidence of public outrage over the $100 million Islamic center.
 
New York media outlets report the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had initially refused to allow the ads.

However, after a federal lawsuit and adjustments making the ad "less inflammatory," the agency backed down after being sued.

"While the MTA does not endorse the views expressed in this or other ads that appear on the transit system, the advertisement purchased by a group opposing a planned mosque near the World Trade Center was accepted today after its review under MTA's advertising guidelines and governing legal standards," MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said Monday.

Nobody should see this promotion of hatred for Muslims and New Yorkers really don't need to see an ad where an airplane is flying into one World Trade Center while the other has the symbol of Muslim Faith on the building.

Yes, it would be cool to add to the 18,000 marriages performed before Prop 8, but unlike those marriages, any performed pursuant to Judge Walker's decision would be invalidated by an adverse appellate ruling, creating a mess for the parties and the state.

The default position in the law is to leave things at the status quo pending a final ruling, which in this case, will almost certainly be the US Supreme Court.

- ()
I'm not convinced that Judge Walker will issue a stay. Having said that, if he doesn't they'll ask the appeals court to issue one, and if they don't, they'll ask the Supreme Court to issue one.
 
In other words you're likely right that a stay will be issued. I just don't feel confident it will come from Walker - especially because there's a major dispute over the "standing" issue. There are serious questions about whether defendant-intervenors in the case have the standing to bring the appeal in the first place.

I don't believe anything was said about his issuing his decision on Fri.

- ()

I mixed things up.

- ()

Although I don't see how that would affect the stay. Even if someone didn't have standing to bring an appeal, the appropriate remedy would simply be to dismiss the appeal (on a motion for the same), which would effectively terminate the stay.

Again, it's simply a default position - maintain the status quo, especially when the parties are appealing an order. I'd venture that a stay is granted in 99% of these cases and I haven't seen anything to suggest that it would be the 1% exception.

And, whether it's Walker (as I think would be typical) or the 9th Circuit, a stay is a stay is a stay - to paraphrase Gertrude Stein.

- ()

on the standing issue that's pretty good.

- ()
I think it falls under the category of "interesting argument, but the court is going to want to get to the merits of the case." I'll admit that I'm not aware of whether the argument was made in the underlying case, which could impact whether it can be made on appeal. But, as a practical matter, I don't see the courts side-stepping this case based on standing. Strange things happen in the law, but this would seem to be a longshot.
 
- ()

the people getting married OR the state are asking for the stay. It's Mrs. Grundy, afraid that the poor gays will make trouble for themselves.

- ()
It would create the same situation where various communities in California gave the green-light to same-sex marriages (in 2004? 2006?) only to have them all later invalidated by the California Supreme Court. The same thing would happen in the event of an unfavorable US Supreme Court decision, only there would be 2 or 3 years worth of marriages that would have to be unwound. And, it's not just a matter of "oh, I guess we're not married any longer." There are legal obligations that arise from marriage - hence the fight in the first place.
 
- ()

But most of the comments, which insist that gay marriage is a "perversion of the sacred union blah blah blah", show that the author is still very much in the minority of our wingnut friends.

- ()
me laugh. The people didn't understand that they totally have the right to oppose same sex marriage on moral grounds but that can't be part of constitutional law.

Here's his explanation:

I watch too much cable, I admit. Day after day it gets frustrating. Yesterday I watched as someone called legislation to prevent teacher layoffs a bailout -- but I know that's not a view held by many, nor were the views I was frustrated about..

REPUBLICANS and assorted rightwing tools have been saying that. If anybody on the dreaded LEFT has been saying that, I'd sure like to see it. It sure isn't the view of most liberals, who not only support this teacher legislation, but want more actions like this.

So Gibbs see some nasty rightwing tool lying on cable about a good policy. His pissed-off reaction...?

If this [emailed HOPA photos] is real, it's the best way to quit a job, ever!

I liked how this JetBlue flight attendant quit the job this week:
A Queens judge has granted bail for a flight attendant accused of cursing out a passenger on an airplane public-address system, grabbing some beer from the galley and exiting on an emergency slide.

Some jerk passenger pulled their overhead luggage out early on the runway, blowing off Slater's warnings to wait and cursing at Slater, before beaning Slater with the bag as it flew out of the compartment. Slater marched to the rear, cursed out the passenger over the PA, quit, grabbed some beers, popped the rear emergency escape door and slid down the inflatable ramp. Take this job and shove it!

I will always regret not quitting my data entry slave job before I was fired for having a brain, because I'd fantasized about ripping off all my clothes and running naked out of the office and down the street. But I once quit by telling my obviously coked-up, ranting boss Rob "Skippy, if you're not going to pretend to make sense, I'm not going to pretend to understand you. I quit." I just wish I'd had an inflatable ramp and a few beers to take down it with me.

From Today's political bullet points via John King at CNN

And THE primary to watch in two weeks, AZ Dem candidate (and lone Latino running for Senate) Randy Parraz in a dead heat against formerly presumed front-runner Rodney Glassman. Parraz has the message, momentum, support from Latinos, GLBT community and many independents. Stay tuned!

From the ground here in Tucson, I totally agree.

- ()

in their presumed DSCC-like rush for a "mainstream" candidate are excusing Glassman's remarks of "I don't know if I could sit next to a gay person?" as "well, that was a whole three years ago!"

People with that level of ignorance/discomfort really change that fast, eh?

If he'd said that about a woman, or a racial minority, I think the sentiments here would be different.

- ()

I was personally infuriated by Glassman's remark and his subsequent refusal to explain or address the issue, no apology, nothing. His supporters have been going with "attack the messenger" for reporting it, and others just can't seem to accept it and are saying thigns like we can't do any better or Glassman is still a "nice guy" but I will never vote for him. I believe Randy Parraz is going to win the primary, and I think he's going to do far better than anyone expects in the general election and could beat McCain. People are seriously underestimating Parraz, IMO.
