						<td>A text or document refers to the unit of analysis for text analysis, and a corpus is a collection of these documents. A document can refer to any length of text from a single tweet to an entire book. 
						<br><br> TACIT’s Corpus Management tool aims to provide a simple user interface to provide an easy and efficient way to manage different types of corpora (or sets of documents/text). The <b>Corpus Management</b> tool can be accessed under <b>View</b> in the main toolbar.  
						Corpus Management allows users’ corpora (documents/sets of text) to be compiled in TACIT at the beginning of a project so that the process of loading and managing the data need not to be repeated multiple times. 
						The corpus management tool can import user data in multiple formats such as JSON, Microsoft Word and CSV files. After creating a corpus in TACIT, the program will automatically record and provide a summary log of how and when the data was collected as well as all analyses performed on that corpus (e.g. type of analysis, date and time of analysis). 
						When such corpora are used for any analysis, users have the ability to filter their data on the basis of various parameters including tweet/comment data, keywords and associated hashtags (called metadata).

						<td> To create a new corpus, click <b>Add Corpus</b> under the <b>Corpora</b>panel. This will open a new <b>Corpus Details</b> section to the right of the list of corpora. 
							Enter the name for this corpus in the <b>Corpus ID</b> text box, and specify the file format of the text/documents that will be in this corpus. TACIT currently supports Plain text, Twitter JSON, and Reddit JSON file formats. 
							You can change both the name of the corpus and the file format settings at any time by selecting the newly created corpus under <b>Corpora</b>.
							If you no longer need a corpus/class, you can remove it by selecting it under <b>Corpora</b> and clicking the <b>Remove</b> button. Removing a corpus will remove all classes underneath it.
