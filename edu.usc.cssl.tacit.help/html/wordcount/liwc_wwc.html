						<td>Word count programs (or dictionary methods) are text analysis tools that quantify the frequency of topics of interest across a document or set of documents that reflects . To accomplish this task, word count programs require a user-defined dictionary of topics, with pre-identified words for each topic. Using this dictionary, the word count program then counts the number of times words in each topic domains occur and calculates the percentage of each document that reflects each topic. 
							<br><br>
							The <b>LIWC-style word count plugin</b> was developed using LIWC documentation (J W Pennebaker, Francis, & Booth, 2001) and reverse engineering of the program to understand and implement the algorithm.  We compared the results of our implementation and the original LIWC software on a variety of test texts, including files from Project Gutenberg. Except for very rare cases (e.g. some occurrences of double hyphens), the result of our plugin provide an exact match with that of LIWC up to the hundredth decimal point. While TACIT provide the word count capability of LIWC, users must import their own dictionaries as it does not provide any of the LIWC dictionary categories.
							<br><br>

						<td> <b>Standard word count</b> techniques are ideal when one is interested in assessing the content features of text because they are binary by nature; 
							these techniques count dictionary words by presence (by adding a 1 to that word's score each time it occurs in the document) or absence (score of 0 if the word never appears) and treat all words within the dictionary as being equally important.
							<br><br>
							By comparison, <b>Weighted word count</b> techniques are often preferred when assessing stylistic variables that capture various degrees of a concept so that dictionary words that are a weaker reflection of the topic count for less than dictionary words that stronger reflect that topic. 
							<br><br>
							For example, if you are interested in assessing negative affect, you may assign a weight of 0.5 to the word "sad" so that it only counts for half of a point during the word count process as "sad" usually reflects relatively low levels of negative affect. By comparison, you may assign
							a weight of 2 to the word "devastated" so that each time the word occurs it counts for 2 points as this word represents much stronger negative affect and thus may be more indicative of the topic.
							<br><br>
							The method you select (standard or weighted) will determine the necessary format of your dictionary files (see the dictionary section below for details).

						<td> TACIT allows users to analyze text using multiple dictionaries simultaneously. However, category number assignment must be consistent across all included dictionaries. Specifically, if category 2 is pronoun in Dictionary_1, the program will assume that category 2 is also pronoun for Dictionary_2. However, both dictionaries do not require that all categories be present. You may introduce additional set of categories in the second dictionary file, as long as the category numbers used are unique from those found in the first dictionary file.

Porter stemming reduces words to their root form (e.g., “running”, “runs” and “ran” would all reduce to “run”) so that they are counted as the same word during analysis. Porter Stemming places an * at the end of each word so that variations of that word are also included in the word count (e.g., "run" becomes "run*" so that "runs" and "running" would also be counted).
