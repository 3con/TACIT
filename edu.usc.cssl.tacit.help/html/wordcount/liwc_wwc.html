						<td>The LIWC-style word count plugin was developed using LIWC documentation (J W Pennebaker, Francis, & Booth, 2001) and reverse engineering of the program to understand and implement the algorithm.  We compared the results of our implementation and the original LIWC software on a variety of test texts, including files from Project Gutenberg. Except for very rare cases (e.g. some occurrences of double hyphens), the result of our plugin provide an exact match with that of LIWC up to the hundredth decimal point. While TACIT provide the word count capability of LIWC, users must import their own dictionaries as it does not provide any of the LIWC dictionary categories.
						
						Word count programs (or dictionary methods) are text analysis tools that quantify the frequency of topics of interest across a document or set of documents that reflects . To accomplish this task, word count programs require a user-defined dictionary of topics, with pre-identified words for each topic. Using this dictionary, the word count program then counts the number of times words in each topic domains occur and calculates the percentage of each document that reflects each topic. <br><br>
							The TACIT plugin includes three different word count techniques:  Standard Word Count, LIWC-style Word Count, and Weighted Word Count. For detailed descriptions of each of these
							options, see "Selecting a Word Count Technique" below.   <br><br>

						<td> TACIT allows users to analyze text using multiple dictionaries simultaneously. However, category number assignment must be consistent across all included dictionaries. Specifically, if category 2 is pronoun in Dictionary_1, the program will assume that category 2 is also pronoun for Dictionary_2. However, both dictionaries do not require that all categories be present. You may introduce additional set of categories in the second dictionary file, as long as the category numbers used are unique from those found in the first dictionary file.
