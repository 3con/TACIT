						<td>It is often useful as a preliminary but important step in data analysis to study the relationships and patterns between concepts. Co-occurrence analysis gives insights into the interconnection between terms or entities within any given text. Two words are said to “co-occur” with each other if both words appear in a defined window size, or within a certain number of words of each other (e.g. in “Fiji apples are red”, “Fiji” and “red” co-occur in a window size of 4). TACIT’s Co-occurrence plugin calculates both word to word level and multi-word level co-occurrences. At the word to word level, the Co-occurrence plugin computes the frequency that each pair of words co-occur in a text or corpus. At the multi-word level, the Co-occurrence tool locates “neighborhoods”  defined as multiple terms (“neighbors”) that co-occur with each other (e.g. “Fiji” and “red” are neighbors within the neighborhood of “Fiji apples are red”). To use this method, users need to specify a set of words that they are interested to see if they co-occur (e.g. “fiji”, “red”, “island”), a threshold for the maximum number of words allowed in a neighborhood (e.g. 4) and a threshold for the minimum number of words to occur in the group from the specified set of words (e.g. 2 for “fiji” & “red”, “fiji” & “island”, “red” & “island” or “fiji”, “red” & “island”). The output of this process are the groups of text satisfying the constraints mentioned above along with their actual location information (i.e. filename and line number). Inferences can be drawn easily through the output of the co-occurrence analysis to locate and verify relationships between given entities. The overall matrix of word pairs frequency can be used to locate clusters, synonyms and learn the overall connections between entities.

						<br><br><b>Word file:</b> This file specifies the words you are interested in including for the co-occurence analysis. Words of interest should be saved in a .txt file on separate lines. 
						<br><b>Window Size:</b> Specify the number of words that can exist between the words from the word file list for the program to count it as co-occurring. If two words are immediately next to each other,
						this number would be 1. Larger window sizes allow words to coexist further from each other and still be counted as occurring together (e.g., window size of 4 would mark "apple" and "Fiji" as co-occurring in the sentence "The apple is from Fiji.")
						<br><b>Threshold:</b> Threshold indicates the smallest number of word combinations from the word list you would like to assess together.  For example, a threshold of 2 would take the combination of each pair of words in the list. A threshold of 3 would take all combinations of 3 words from the list, but not word pairs.
