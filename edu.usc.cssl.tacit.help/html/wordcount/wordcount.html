						<td>Word count programs (or dictionary methods) are text analysis tools that quantify the frequency of topics of interest across a document or set of documents that reflects . To accomplish this task, word count programs require a user-defined dictionary of topics, with pre-identified words for each topic. Using this dictionary, the word count program then counts the number of times words in each topic domains occur and calculates the percentage of each document that reflects each topic. <br><br>
							The TACIT plugin includes three different word count techniques:  Standard Word Count, LIWC-style Word Count, and Weighted Word Count. For detailed descriptions of each of these
							options, see "Selecting a Word Count Technique" below.   <br><br>

All files and folders added to the input panel are automatically selected to be included in analysis by the check mark box to the left of the file/folder name. The number of files selected for analysis is indicated at the bottom of the input panel. To de-select an unwanted folder or file, uncheck the box next to its name. To remove a file completely from the program list, click on the file name to highlight it, and then click the "Remove" button.  Note: Files within folders cannot be removed without removing the entire folder.
						<br><br> <b> Add Folder: </b> The Add Folder button will allow you to add a folder and all included subfolders and files for analysis. To expand the folder and view the subfolders/files included, click on the arrow to the left of the folder name in the input panel.   
						<br><b> Add File(s): </b>  The Add Files button will allow you to add .txt files to be included for analysis. Multiple files within the same folder can be selected at the same time using standard multi-select functions.

						<td> TACIT allows users to analyze text using multiple dictionaries simultaneously. However, category number assignment must be consistent across all included dictionaries. Specifically, if category 2 is pronoun in Dictionary_1, the program will assume that category 2 is also pronoun for Dictionary_2. However, both dictionaries do not require that all categories be present. You may introduce additional set of categories in the second dictionary file, as long as the category numbers used are unique from those found in the first dictionary file.
