						<td>Word count programs (or dictionary methods) are text analysis tools that quantify the frequency of topics of interest across a document or set of documents.
						 	To accomplish this task, word count programs require a user-defined dictionary of topics, with pre-identified words for each topic. 
							 Using this dictionary, the word count program then counts the number of times words in each topic domains occur and calculates the percentage of each document that reflects each topic. 
						 	 <br><br>
							 The <b>TACIT Word Count plugin </b>was developed exclusively for the TACIT tool as a more comprehensive approach to word count techniques. 
							 Rather than only relying on static categories, the Standard Word Count tool uses <a href = "http://opennlp.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache OpenNLP</a> to automatically segment sentences, tokenize words and find the part of speech tags of all words in the text.
							 We believe that this is a more modern and comprehensive approach to segmenting sentences and counting parts of speech compared to LIWC’s approach (e.g. locating “.” as marker for sentences).  
							 By default, analyses using this tool report word counts for the categories in user-provided dictionaries. Our wordcount is a straightforward implementation where, if a word exists in the user dictionary, it is considered, else it is ignored.
							 This tool uses Apache OpenNLP's POS tagging API to calculate part of speech tag counts and words per sentence.
							 <br><br>
							 This tool provides additional word count options, including weighted word count capabilities and default part of speech tag counts (e.g., numbers, symbols, defaults based on <a href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/" target="_blank">The Penn Treebank Project</a>).

				<tr>
						<td> <b>Standard word count</b> techniques are ideal when one is interested in assessing the content features of text because they are binary by nature; 
							these techniques count dictionary words by presence (by adding a 1 to that word's score each time it occurs in the document) or absence (score of 0 if the word never appears) and treat all words within the dictionary as being equally important.
							<br><br>
							By comparison, <b>Weighted word count</b> techniques are often preferred when assessing stylistic variables that capture various degrees of a concept so that dictionary words that are a weaker reflection of the topic count for less than dictionary words that stronger reflect that topic. 
							<br><br>
							For example, if you are interested in assessing negative affect, you may assign a weight of 0.5 to the word "sad" so that it only counts for half of a point during the word count process as "sad" usually reflects relatively low levels of negative affect. By comparison, you may assign
							a weight of 2 to the word "devastated" so that each time the word occurs it counts for 2 points as this word represents much stronger negative affect and thus may be more indicative of the topic.
							<br><br>
							The method you select (standard or weighted) will determine the necessary format of your dictionary files (see the dictionary section below for details).
