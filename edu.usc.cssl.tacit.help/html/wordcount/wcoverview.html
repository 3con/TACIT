						<td>Word count techniques measure the amount that a certain document reflects a predetermined topic of interest using researcher created dictionaries. To use this method, the researcher manually or through crowdsourcing first creates a list of words they believe are related to a topic of interest called a dictionary. For example, if they are interested in the use of moral words, they might create a dictionary of words including ethic, moral, right, etc. Then, the program uses this dictionary and counts the number of times the words occur in each document of interest. These programs provide information about the total number of words in a document as well as the percentage of words in each document from each topic.
