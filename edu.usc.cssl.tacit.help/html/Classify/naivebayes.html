						<td>Naive Bayes classification is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to assess the uniqueness of text files belonging to user-determined set of two or more distinct groups (called classes, e.g., Democrats, Republicans, and Independents). This tool can also predict the classes of documents that have not yet been sorted into a group. 
						After using the naive Bayes plugin to label unclassified data, users can conduct further analyses on the automatically classified dataset.
						<br><br>Naive Bayes classification is accomplished by applying Bayes theorem, which (like Word Count techniques) assumes that all language features (i.e. single words, punctuation, etc) are independent from one another. While this assumption is often incorrect (e.g., the words "fried" and "chicken" mean something different when they are put together as "fried chicken"), it permits the algorithm to work quickly and efficiently, which often yields benefits 
						that outweigh the costs of the independence assumption. Classification is accomplished through three steps. First, the researcher organizes and labels documents according to the groups they are interested in assessing and then splits the dataset into a training subset and testing subset. The classifier uses the training subset of data to determine features (i.e., words) that distinguish the groups from each other. 
						The classifier then uses this information to test how accurately the trained algorithm can predict group membership for the remaining labeled documents in the test subset. Finally, if the trained classifier is sufficiently accurate, the algorithm can be used to predict which group (or class) any remaining unsorted documents belong in. 
						<br><br>
						To implement a naive Bayes algorithm, the only definite requirement is that the documents be pre-sorted into the groups the user is interested in comparing.	
						During the training process, the algorithm extracts features from training texts that are predictive of class association. 
						The extraction of these features is both automatic and optimized, so it is not necessary to specify the number features to be extracted.

						<td> All input data files must be saved as corpus classes (subgroups) within a corpus in <a href = "../corpusmanage/corpusmanage.html" target="_blank">Corpus Management</a> or as .txt files within separate folders to be compatible with TACIT. See the <b>Corpus Management Help Section</b> if you need to convert files to compatible formats. 
							Notably, the naive Bayes tool does not require that data be split into training and test sets. When the algorithm is run, 
							the data contained in the class directories is automatically split into training and test sets, following a 90% to 10% 
							ratio, respectively.

						 	To specify which classes/groups you would like to compare in analysis, select <b>Add Corpus</b> or <b>Add Folder</b> under the <b>Input Details</b> panel. All corpora and folders added to the Input Details panel are automatically selected to be included in analysis by the check mark box to the left of the corpus/file/folder name. The number of files selected for analysis is indicated at the bottom of the input panel. To de-select an unwanted folder or file, uncheck the box next to its name. 
							<br><br> 
							<b> Add Corpus: </b> The Add Corpus button will allow you to add a group/class from a corpus stored in <a href = "../corpusmanage/corpusmanage.html" target="_blank">Corpus Management</a></b>.

						<td> <b>K-value for Cross Validation:</b> K-fold validation determines the accuracy of the classifier at sorting the texts into groups based on the features it has identified. The number entered in this text box specifies
							the number of equal-sized randomly generated subsamples the text should be split into. One of these subsamples is then randomly selected as the test set for feature identification and
							the algorithm is trained on the remaining samples. This process is then repeated k-times (the folds) so that each subsample 
							is used once as the test set. The error rates obtained from each fold are then averaged to estimate the actual error rate.  
							Any number up to the total sample size can be specified as the k-value; however, k=10 is one of the most commonly used values.
