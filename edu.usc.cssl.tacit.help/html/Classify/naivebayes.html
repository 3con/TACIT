						<td>Naive Bayes methods are a family of supervised learning algorithms that are used to classify text files according 
						to a user-determined set of class types. Naive Bayes classification is accomplished by applying Bayes theorem with the strong assumption
						that dependent features (i.e. dependent variables) are statistically independent. While this assumption
						is often violated, it permits naive Bayes algorithms to work quickly and efficiently, which often yields benefits 
						that outweigh the costs of the independence assumption. 
						To implement a naive Bayes algorithm, the only definite requirement is that class labeled data instances are available for 
						algorithm training and testing. If this condition is satisfied, implementation is executed through three steps:  <br> <br>
			
						<b>1.</b> Splitting labeled data into training and test data sets <br>
						<b>2.</b> Training the algorithm on the training data <br>
						<b>3.</b> Estimating the trained algorithm's error rate by testing it on the test data set <br> <br>
						
						If a project step also includes classifying unlabeled data instances, a fourth step is required: <br> <br>
						<b>4.</b> Using the trained algorithm to probabilistically assign a class to a set of unlabeled data instances.

						<td> The Naive Bayes tool can be used to learn probabilistic associations between text instances and class labels. 
							 During the training process, the algorithm extracts features from training texts that are predictive of class association.
							 The extraction of these features is both automatic and optimized, so it is not necessary to specify the number features 
							 to be extracted.

						 	<br><br>
						 	To specify which files you would like to analyze, select <b>Add Corpus</b>,<b>Add Folder</b>, or <b>Add File(s)</b> under the Input panel.

						 	To remove a file completely from the program list, click on the file name to highlight it, and then click the "Remove" button.  Note: Files within folders/corpora cannot be removed from the tool without removing the entire folder or corpus, but de-selecting files using the check boxes will remove them from analysis.

						Notably, the naive Bayes tool does not require that data be split into training and test sets. When the algorithm is run, 
						the data contained in the class directories is automatically split into training and test sets, following a 90% to 10% 
						ratio, respectively. <br> <br> 
						
						In order to use a trained algorithm to classify unlabeled data, it is also necessary to organize the unlabeled data.
						Each instance must be contained in a separate file and all files must be stored in a single directory. The <b>classify 
						data</b> option must then be selected and the directory that contains the unlabeled data must be specified as the 
						<b>Classification Input Path</b>. Both of these fields are located in the <b>Classification</b> area of the naive Bayes window
						in TACIT.<br><br>

						<td> In order to estimate the accuracy of the classifier, thes naive Bayes module uses k-fold validation. K-fold validation 
						randomly splits a data set into k equal sized subsamples. One of these subsamples is then randomly selected as the test set and
						the algorithm is trained on the remaining k-1 samples. This process is then repeated k-times (the folds) so that each subsample 
						is used once as the test set. The error rates obtained from each fold are then averaged to estimate the actual error rate.  
						Any number up to the total sample size can be specified as the k-value; however, k=10 is one of the most commonly used values.
