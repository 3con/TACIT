						<td>TACIT's SVM classification plugin can be used to investigate the degree to which two classes 
						can be separated based on the provided data. The plugin requires that the researcher pre-organizes their texts by class into 
						separate directories/corpora. Once the data is organized by group, the SVM plugin automatically 
						conducts training and test runs on the data, determines predictive accuracy, and calculates relevant 
						classification statistics. The SVM plugin supports k-fold cross validation of accuracy rates and can 
						provide information about the features that distinguish the groups from each other.

						<td>The data output will be in .csv file format. The file name includes the type of technique used for analysis and the time-stamp for when the analysis was completed.
						 Two files are automatically generated by the SVM tool: (1) a summary .txt file, which states the run time, TACIT version number, and the tool used and (2) an 
						 accuracy report. The accuracy report contains an accuracy statistic that ranges 0 to 100 (100 = perfect accuracy) for each k-fold run and an average accuracy
						 statistic that is aggregated across cross-validation runs. These accuracy statistics can be used to evaluate the distinguishability of the analyzed classes. 
						 
						 <br> <br>
						 If the <b> Create feature weights</b> option was selected for an analysis, feature weight .csv files will be created for each k-fold validation run. 
						 These feature weights can be used to gain insight into the role individual data features (e.g. words) played in the classification process. For example,
						 by examining the features that are most heavily weighted, users can identify the features that had the greatest discriminative predictive power. This can be
						 valuable for identifying and understanding differences between classes.
