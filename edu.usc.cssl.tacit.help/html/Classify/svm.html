						<td>TACIT’s SVM classification plugin can be used to investigate the degree to which classes can be separated based on the provided data, as well as to classify unlabeled data points for later analyses. Both plugins require that the researcher pre-organizes their texts by class into separate directories/corpora. Once the data is organized by group, the SVM plugin automatically conducts training and test runs on the data, determines predictive accuracy, and calculates relevant classification statistics. The SVM plugin supports k-fold cross validation of accuracy rates and can provide information about the features that distinguish the groups from each other.
