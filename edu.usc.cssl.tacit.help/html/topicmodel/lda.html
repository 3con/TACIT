						<td>TACIT’s <b>LDA plugin</b> allows you to explore the structure of topics within a set of documents and the relations between them. Researchers can adjusting the number of topics generated to focus the level of granularity, with smaller numbers of topics generating a few overarching themes to larger numbers of topics providing many tightly focused topics. Each topic is described by a distribution over the words in the vocabulary, allowing you to see which words are most associated with that topic and explore connections between them across the entire corpus. Additionally, each document is described by the mixture of topics which underlie it, providing a way to compare topic use across documents.
