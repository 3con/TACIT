						<td>TACIT’s seeded <b>z-label LDA plugin</b> expands upon the capabilities of LDA by implementing the z-label LDA (Andrzejewski & Zhu, 2009) algorithm. Z-label LDA allows the researcher to provide a word or list of words they are interested in exploring called seed words.The algorithm then uses these seed words as the core of the topics that it generates, building the rest of the words around those key concepts.
