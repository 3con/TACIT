						<td>TACIT's seeded <b>z-label LDA plugin</b> expands upon the capabilities of LDA by implementing the z-label LDA (Andrzejewski & Zhu, 2009) algorithm. 
						Z-label LDA allows the researcher to provide a word or list of words they are interested in exploring called seed words. 
						The algorithm then uses these seed words as the core of the topics that it generates, building the rest of the words around those key concepts.

					<td> All input data files must be saved as a corpus in <a href = "../corpusmanage/corpusmanage.html" target="_blank">Corpus Management</a> or in .txt file format to be compatible with TACIT. See the <b>Corpus Management Help Section</b> if you need to convert files to compatible formats.
						 	<br><br>
						 	To specify which files you would like to analyze, select <b>Add Corpus</b>,<b>Add Folder</b>, or <b>Add File(s)</b> under the Input panel. All files and folders added to the input panel are automatically selected to be included in analysis by the check mark box to the left of the corpus/file/folder name. The number of files selected for analysis is indicated at the bottom of the input panel. To de-select an unwanted folder or file, uncheck the box next to its name. 
						 	To remove a file completely from the program list, click on the file name to highlight it, and then click the "Remove" button.  Note: Files within folders/corpora cannot be removed from the tool without removing the entire folder or corpus, but de-selecting files using the check boxes will remove them from analysis.
							<br><br> 
							<b> Add Corpus: </b> The Add Corpus button will allow you to add a stored corpus from <a href = "../corpusmanage/corpusmanage.html" target="_blank">Corpus Management</a></b> and all included sub-groups and fies for analysis. To expand the corpus and view the subgroups/files included, click on the arrow to the left of the corpus name in the input panel.   
							<br>
							<b> Add Folder: </b> The Add Folder button will allow you to add a folder and all included subfolders and files for analysis. To expand the folder and view the subfolders/files included, click on the arrow to the left of the folder name in the input panel.   
							<br>
							<b> Add File(s): </b>  The Add Files button will allow you to add .txt files to be included for analysis. Multiple files within the same folder can be selected at the same time using standard multi-select functions.
 							<br><br>
 							
 							In addition to specifying the input files for the analysis, the ZLabel LDA tool also requires a list of <b>seed words</b>. 
 							The seed words should be listed in a single .txt formatted file. To input a seed words file, use the <b>Browse</b> button 
 							located next to the <b>Seed File Location</b> input box in the input path field.

After specifying all parameters, click the <b>green and white play button</b> (Image 1) located in the top right corner of the window to run the program. Output information will display in the console panel at the bottom of the tool.
