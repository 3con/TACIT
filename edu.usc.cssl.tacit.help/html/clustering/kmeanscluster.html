						<td>The <b>K-means clustering plugin</b> (MacQueen, 1967) aims to cluster texts into a user-specified number of cluster (or groups) such that the texts included in each cluster are the nearest to the cluster’s centroid (the prototypical document of that cluster), and have the farthest distance from other clusters’ centroids. Once this optimization is performed, TACIT outputs a csv file containing the membership information for the documents in the corpus.
