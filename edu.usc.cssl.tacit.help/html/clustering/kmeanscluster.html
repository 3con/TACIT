						<td>The <b>K-means clustering plugin</b> (MacQueen, 1967) aims to cluster texts into a user-specified number of cluster (or groups) such that the texts included in each cluster are the nearest to the cluster’s centroid (the prototypical document of that cluster), and have the farthest distance from other clusters’ centroids. Once this optimization is performed, TACIT outputs a csv file containing the membership information for the documents in the corpus.

After specifying all parameters, click the <b>green and white play button</b> located in the top right corner of the window to run the program. Output information will display in the console panel at the bottom of the tool.
