						<td><b>Hierarchical clustering</b> (Johnson, 1967) by comparison does not require a prespecified number of clusters. Instead, this technique identifies the optimal number of clusters by starting with the assumption that all data points (in this case documents) belong to one cluster. The algorithm then splits this root cluster into smaller child clusters based on the degree of similarity between the documents. These child clusters are recursively divided further until only singleton clusters remain. which have the longest distance. Besides providing a csv file with membership information, TACIT also provides the option to visualize the clusters in a dendrogram which presents an overview of hierarchies of clusters.
