						<td><b>Hierarchical clustering</b> (Johnson, 1967) by comparison does not require a prespecified number of clusters. Instead, this technique identifies the optimal number of clusters by starting with the assumption that all data points (in this case documents) belong to one cluster. The algorithm then splits this root cluster into smaller child clusters based on the degree of similarity between the documents. These child clusters are recursively divided further until only singleton clusters remain. which have the longest distance. Besides providing a csv file with membership information, TACIT also provides the option to visualize the clusters in a dendrogram which presents an overview of hierarchies of clusters.

					<td>To specify an output folder where crawled files will be saved, click on the <b>Browse</b> button to the right of the Output Location bar and select a folder. If you create a new folder within this menu and change its name from "New Folder", click on any other folder and then click back on your newly created & renamed folder to select it. After specifying all parameters, click the <b>green and white play button</b> located in the top right corner of the window to run the program. Output information will display in the console panel at the bottom of the tool.
