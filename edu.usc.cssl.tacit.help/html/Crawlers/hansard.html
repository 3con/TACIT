						The Hansard crawler can collect data by either a user specified <b> Keyword Search </b> or by a search of <b> House Members</b>
						<br><br>
						<b> Keyword Search: </b> The keyword search allows you to crawl the website for reports containing specified keywords.  
						You may check the box to limit by a date range and then specify the from and/ or to dates in the following boxes in the 
						format MM/DD/YYYY.  You may also choose to limit the number of results crawled to a desired number. 
						<br>
						<b> House Member Search:</b>The house member search does not allow you to enter a keyword, but instead use the following House 
						Member Search segment. Here, you can enter the name of one or more house members, as well as the number of articles you desire from each house member.  
						You may also opt to enter the name of a different Congress Member in addition or instead of the house member search.
