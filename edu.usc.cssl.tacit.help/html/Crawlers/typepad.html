						Typepad is a website that publishes blogs, and this crawler allows users to crawl blog posts with various filtering options including keyword search for titles, blog post text, or both. The crawler
						will collect data from the most recent relevant blogs, the most relevant blogs, the most recent blogs, or the least recent blogs. The data is then saved in a format that is
						accessible and analyzable by the TACIT tool as well as other language analysis programs. <br><br>
