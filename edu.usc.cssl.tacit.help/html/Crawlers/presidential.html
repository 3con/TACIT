						The presidential crawler can collect data using either a keyword search, or when no keyword is selected, using other filtering features such as the President or time frame.
						<br><br> 
						<b> Keyword Search: </b> Presidential papers can be crawled based on a single keyword or a combination of two keywords. To search and collect papers including one keyword, supply the keyword in the keyword 1 box. 
						If you are interested in two keywords, you can provide a second keyword in the Keyword 2 box. If using two keywords, you can select (<b>and</b>) to only collect documents with both terms present, (<b>or</b>)to select
						 documents with at least one of the keywords present, or (<b>not</b>)to select documents that include the first keyword but not the second keyword.
						<br><br> 
						<b>Additional Crawler Filters: </b> Regardless of whether or not a keyword is supplied, you may also select from the following additional filters and restrictions to tailor the results crawled from the presidential papers.
						<br>
						<b>Specify Date Range and Specify Date: </b> By default, neither a date range or a date is specified when neither of the boxes are checked, regardless of the “From:” and “To:” fields being filled.  Checking the Specify Date
						 Range box allows you to enter in a start and end date for desired articles.  You may either type in the date in the format MM/DD/YYYY, or use the drop down button to select start and end dates.  Checking the Specify Date box allows you to enter one specific date for crawling.
						<br>
						<b>Select President: </b> The Select President field allows you to select the president that you would like to crawl for.  You may also choose to select the “President” option (the default), which will crawl all papers from all presidents.
						<br>
						<b>Select Document Category: </b> The Select Document Category allows you to specify the type of document you would like to crawl for.  This includes various types of oral documentation, writings, debates, and more.
