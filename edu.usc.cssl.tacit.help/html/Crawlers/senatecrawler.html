						<td>The United States Senate Crawler is a program that automatically scans and collects speech transcription data from the <a href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/home/LegislativeData.php?&n=Record" target="_blank">Library of Congress THOMAS Website</a> and writes that data into text files that are readable by automated text analysis programs.
						This crawler also saves additional information about the speeches in a summary csv file (e.g., the name of the speaker, the date of the speech).

						<td> You will need to determine which Senate speeches you would like the crawler to collect under the <b> Input Parameters </b> panel. First, select the <b> Congress </b> you would like to crawl from the drop down menu. Next, click the <b> Add </b> button to the right of the Senator box to select the senator(s) in that Congress for which you wish to collect data. Speeches can be collected for individual Senators, all Senators, or for all Senators with a particular party affiliation (i.e., Republican, Democrat, Independent).

						<td> To download a subset of speeches from a selected Senator (thus decreasing the number of files created), check the box next to <b> Limit Records per Senator </b> in the Limit Records panel. Next, enter the number of speeches you would like in the <b> No.of.Records per Senator </b> box. If <b> Sort Records by Date </b> is set to <b> yes </b>, the crawler will return the number of speeches requested in chronological order starting from the most recent speech on record.  If <b>no</b> is selected, the crawler will return the number of speeches requested as a random subset of that Senator's records.

						<td>The <b> Console </b> panel at the bottom of the tool provides information about the congress member selected, the website url being crawled, and the names of the files being created while the crawler is running. Once complete, the console will print the total number of files created.  The data gathered for each speech will be saved in .txt text file format, with a separate file for each speech and separate folders for each senator. The generated text file name format is: Congress#-Senator last name-party affiliation-state affiliation-date-title (e.g., 114-Ayotte-R-NH-June 10 2015-NATIONAL DEFENS-355.txt)
						<br><br>
						The program will also create a overview file called <b> senate-summary-[date-time].csv </b>. This .csv file provides a summary of all files created with additional documentation about each file including (when available): Congress number, Speech Date, Senator Name, Political Affiliation, US State Affiliation, Title of Speech, and the downloaded file name.
