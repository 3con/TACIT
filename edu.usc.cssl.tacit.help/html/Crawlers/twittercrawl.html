						<td>Before you can start using the TACIT crawler, Twitter requires that you set up an API which provides specific account-tied authorization information to grant the tool permission to crawl their website. 
						<br>To acquire this authentication information from Twitter:	
						<br><b>1.</b> Go to  http://twitter.com/apps and log into your twitter account (or create an account if you don't already have one).
						<br><b>2.</b>  The creation Application page will open. Click on Create Application.
						<br><b>3.</b>  Fill in the TACIT crawler specifications 
								<br>	application name: [name that will help you keep track of your data]
								<br>	app description: [description that will help you keep track of your data]
								<br>	website: http://cssl.usc.edu
								<br>	callback url: [leave blank]
						<br><b>4.</b>  You will then be provided an overview page with details about the application you just set up for crawling. Click on the  Keys and Access Tokens Tab. Here, you  will find the information needed for the TACIT Twitter User Configuration form. Copy the Consumer key and Consumer secret into the TACIT preferences page.
						<br><b>5.</b>  At the bottom of the page under Token Actions, click Generate My Access Token. Copy the <b>Access Token</b> and <b>Access Token Secret</b> into the spaces provided on the <b>TACIT Preferences </b> page and click apply. 
						<br><b>6.</b>  Your name should now appear in the grey User Name box if the information was entered successfully. Click OK to close the preferences page.
						<br> Step-by-step instructions with pictures for setting up the Twitter API/retrieving access tokens can be found <a href = "https://code.google.com/p/socialauth-android/wiki/Twitter" target="_blank">here</a>.

						<td>Twitter data can be crawled based on keywords (Word Filter) or locations (Geo Filter) of interest.
						<td>The <b>Word Filter</b> allows you to crawl for tweets using a specific keyword or set of keywords. For multiple keywords, separate each word by entering a semicolon in between each word. 
						<br><br>The <b>Geo Filter</b> lets you enter in a specific geolocation box (latitude and longitude) to crawl tweets that originate from a certain location. To determine the bounding box needed for your area of interest, you can use the tool available at http://boundingbox.klokantech.com/. Change the <b>Copy & Paste</b> option in the bottom panel drop down menu to CSV. You can then enter in the name of the city, state, or country you want to crawl or click and drag the selection box on the map to the desired location. The geo-coordiate box for that area will appear at the bottom of the page. Copy paste these numbers into the Geo Filter box in the TACIT tool. If you would like to crawl from multiple distinct locations, simply add the geo-coordiate box for each location into the tool separated by semi-colons.

							<br><br>
							The <b>Maximum Limit</b> section limits the number of tweets to crawl. The Twitter crawler is automatically set to download 10 total tweets per request. This option can be changed to any number of tweets you are interested in collecting. The tool will continue to run until the number is reached.
