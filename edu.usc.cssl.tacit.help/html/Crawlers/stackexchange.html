This crawler provides various filtering options that can be used to search for specific Q/A domains and tags. This data is then saved in a format that is accessible and analyzable by the TACIT tool as well as other language analysis algorithms.

								<br>
								<b> Collect Answer/Comment Text: </b> These check boxes allow you to specify whether you would like to collect the answers and comments associated with the questions.  If you select these boxes, the crawler will default to collecting 5 answers and 5 comments per question.
								<br>
								<b>User Details for Questions/Answers/Comments</b> collect information about the users whose text you are collecting including user id, username, user reputation, and whether or not they are registered.
								<br>
								<b>Is Question Answered:</b> Selecting this box will limit results to only questions with answers.

						<b>Crawl Order </b> will let you specify whether you would like the results to be collected started with the most recent questions that match your request or if you would prefer to have the crawl return a random subset of all questions that fit your parameters regardless of post date.
