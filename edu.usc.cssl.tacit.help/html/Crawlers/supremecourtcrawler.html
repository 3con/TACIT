						<td>The US Supreme Court Crawler is a program that automatically scans and collects court case transcription data from the IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law <a href = "http://www.oyez.org/cases" target="_blank">Supreme Court Case Website</a> and writes that data into text files that are readable by automated text analysis programs.
						This crawler also saves meta data about each file (e.g., majority author, date decided; see output section below) and includes options to download case audio mp3 files.

							<br><br>
							Selecting the <b>Term</b> filter type will allow you to select cases by calendar year.  Cases are grouped by single year and also by decade. 
							<br><br>
							Selecting the <b>Issues</b> filter type will allow you to select cases by topic or social issue of interest.

						<td>Next, you will need to specify an output path folder where the downloaded text files will be stored. To specify an output folder where crawled files will be saved, click on the <b> Browse </b> button to the right of the Output Location bar and select a folder. If you create a new folder within this menu and change its name from "New Folder", click on any other folder and then click back on your newly created & renamed folder to select it.
						<b> Note: </b> The program does not create a new folder for the files it creates. If you would like your files saved together into a single folder, we recommend creating a new folder for the output in advance and selecting that folder as the output location.

						option to check the "Truncate" box which will only download the first mb of each audio file. Note that this does not compress the original full audio file and selecting this option will only provide the beginning of the full file.

Once complete, the data gathered will be in .txt text file format, with a separate .txt for each document. The generated text file name format is:The court case transcription output will be saved in .txt text file format, with a separate .txt for each document/case. File Names xxxx. Documents will be organized by xxx. 
						
						<br><br>The program will also output a file called <b> supremecourt-summary-[date-time].csv </b>.
