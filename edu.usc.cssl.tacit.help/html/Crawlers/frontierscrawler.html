						<td>The Frontiers Journal Crawler tool collects text from the <a href = "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/psychology" target="_blank">Frontiers in Psychology website</a>, 
							a site that provides an Open Science platform and publishes many widely known open-access journals. The crawler allows you to search for data pertaining to specific fields 
							including Science, Health, Engineering, and Humanities and Social Sciences. Then based on these fields, you select more specific sub-domains. The tool also allows you to 
							further filter your results by limiting the number of pages being collected. The data is then saved in a format that is accessible and analyzable by the TACIT tool as well 
							as other language analysis algorithms.

							The <b>Select Sub-Domains </b> option allows you to further narrow the type of data collected from the various journals. You must press the Add button to pull up your
							choices of sub-domains and apply them to the search. In order for the crawler to run, you must select at least one sub-domain.
							<br><br>
							You can limit the number of pages being collected in the <b>Filter Results</b> section. Once you select the check box next to the option, you can enter the number of records per topic you want.
