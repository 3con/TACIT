						<td>The Reddit Crawler provides full access to all data available on Reddit.com. This crawler provides various filtering options that can be used to search for specific topics, keywords and authors, from subreddits through either the full website, the trending data or top/controversial section of the website. This data, including vote counts, is then saved in a format that is accessible and analyzable by the TACIT tool as well as other language analysis algorithms.
