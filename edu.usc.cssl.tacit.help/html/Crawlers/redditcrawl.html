This crawler provides various filtering options that can be used to search for specific topics, keywords and authors, from subreddits through either the full website, the trending data or top/controversial section of the website. This data, including vote counts, is then saved in a format that is accessible and analyzable by the TACIT tool as well as other language analysis algorithms.
