							PLOS is a website that provides an open access platform for scientific research articles to be published in an impactful and accessible setting. 
							The crawler provides various filtering settings including a word filter option and an author filter option. Users can choose the specific attributes 
							they want collected with their data, and can also set a maximum limit for the number of documents they want to be crawled. The data is saved in a
							format that is accessible and analyzable by the TACIT tool as well as other language analysis algorithms.
