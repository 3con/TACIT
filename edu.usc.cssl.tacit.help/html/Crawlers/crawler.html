						<td>We designed TACIT’s Crawler plugins to automate this data compilation stage. The five built-in TACIT Crawlers search and download relevant content from various historical (the Latin Library Crawler), political (the US Supreme Court and US Congress Crawlers) and social media (the Reddit and Twitter crawlers) services to make this data available for further processing in TACIT or any other text-processing tool. All data that is downloaded using TACIT’s crawlers is automatically converted by the Corpus Management tool into a corpus (annotated collection of texts), which can be used for analysis within the TACIT program or exported as plain text files for use in other analysis software.
