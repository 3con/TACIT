						<td> TACIT: Text Analysis, Crawling and Investigation Tool. TACIT is an open-source architecture that establishes a pipeline between the various stages of text-based research by integrating tools for text mining, data cleaning, and analysis under a single user-friendly architecture. In addition to being prepackaged with a range of easily applied, cutting-edge methods, TACIT’s design also allows other researchers to write their own plugins. 
						<br><br> TACIT’s plugin architecture has three main components: 1. Crawling plugins, for automated text collection from online sources  2.  Corpus management, for applying standard text preprocessing to prepare and store corpora. 3. Analysis plugins: including LIWC-type word count, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, clustering and classification. TACIT’s open-source plugin platform allows the architecture to easily adapt with the rapid developments in automated text analysis. Certain plugins in TACIT provide a researcher-friendly interface to well known libraries used in computational linguistics (e.g. Stanford CoreNLP; Manning et al., 2014) and machine learning (e.g. Weka3; Bouckaert et al., 2010), while other algorithms have been implemented specifically for TACIT (e.g. the crawlers). Given that computational text analysis is slowly becoming a field norm, TACIT can vastly increase psychologists’ access to both large-scale textual data and and cutting-edge text analysis methods. Below, we discuss each of TACIT’s components in detail.
