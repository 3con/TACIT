         Text analysis has become increasingly important for psychological research, and 

measuring psychological and demographic properties using computational text 

analysis is slowly becoming a field norm. Though several limited-method tools for 

text analysis are already available (e.g. LIWC), and some have become part of 

standard statistical packages (e.g., SPSS Text Analytics), a unified, open-source 

architecture for gathering, managing and analyzing text does not exist. We 

introduce TACIT: An Open-Source Text Analysis, Crawling and Interpretation 

Tool. TACIT’s plugin architecture has three main components: 1. Crawling 

plugins, for automated text collection from online sources (e.g., US Senate and 

Supreme Court speech transcriptions, Twitter, Reddit) 2. Corpus management, 

for applying standard text preprocessing to prepare and store corpora. 3. 

Analysis plugins: including LIWC-type word count, topic modeling, sentiment 

analysis, clustering and classification. TACIT’s open-source plugin platform 

allows the architecture to easily adapt with the rapid developments in automated 

text analysis.
