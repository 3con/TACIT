Fox News host Greg Gutfeld has an interesting response to the Ground Zero mosque: he's opening a gay bar nearby.

The "RedEye" host wrote on his blog Monday that he's "planning to build and open the first gay bar that caters not only to the west, but also Islamic gay men."

"As an American, I believe they have every right to build the mosque - after all, if they buy the land and they follow the law - who can stop them?" he wrote.  "Which is, why, in the spirit of outreach, I've decided to do the same thing."

Gutfeld insists "this is not a joke," and is soliciting investors for the project, which he says will occupy an "available commercial space" next to the planned mosque.

"As you know, the Muslim faith doesn't look kindly upon homosexuality, which is why I'm building this bar. It is an effort to break down barriers and reduce deadly homophobia in the Islamic world," he wrote, adding that he'll have an entire Islam-friendly floor that serves non-alcoholic drinks.

HotAir reports that Gutfeld is "quite serious."

    Models for pluralistic societies based on liberal democratic values exist throughout the historical landscape, independent of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It bodes well that they may be freely adopted by all cultures.

    The mosque controversy is not really about a mosque at all; it's about the presence of Muslims in America, and the free-floating anxiety and fear that now dominate the nation's psyche.

    Adherents to Islam form a vulnerable racial minority before a prejudiced media that uses religious misnomers like "Islamic terrorist" to develop public support for attacking adherents to Islam, a word that literally means "Peace."

    A longstanding effort to build a Muslim center that ended up being near what became "Ground Zero" has become Exhibit A in the contest between popular passion and constitutional principle.

There's actually a beginning of a flowering of gay Muslim youth culture. I see it in the US, but I'm sure it's happening in europe as well. Not that they'd go to this racist homophobic lowlifes bar.

Many of the comparisons people are making are ludicrous. He is making a point about Islam respecting American's, New Yorker's, and the 9/11 families' sensitivities the same way they wish everyone to respect theirs. Plain and simple.

Back Door to Mecca or the 20th Guy Jacker

Can we call it Hallah? You know, like hollar?

Wow! Fantastic idea. The bar should have "YMCA" blaring out of the front door every time the muezzin calls the congregation to prayer.

 Yeah! That's the ticket!

Infact so called Christians have done terrible things in the name of Jesus. Who never told them to.
 
Worst than 9-11.

So, that makes it Ok?

No neither action is ok, that's the point you seem to be missing.
 
As for your other waste of space posts no faux news telling you the Muslims are trying to turn American law to Shariah law is simply just not true no matter how many times faux and you drones repeat it.
 
Spare me your defense of Christianity if you knew even a fraction of the atrocities committed in the name of Christians you would zip your pie hole about how bad Muslims are.
 
We are a nation of law.
Not a nation of religion.

Not everyone who says they are a christian are...
 
True Christians know these things don't matter.
 
Let them build it...
 
Infact let newyorkers decide.

This guy is like a high schooler...
 
Seriously dude grow up!
 
When it come time to pratice what you preach it's a problem.
 
Funny..

Greg Gutfeld was named one of the most anti-gay voices in the media by a LGBT group (which I can't find the name of). He has proven time and time again that he is not a supporter of gay rights.
 
Regardless of where it is, leaving aside the fact that I have a problem with gays being used as a political tool to offend, in retaliation to something that does not call for retaliation, I do not want him opening a gay bar any more than I would want David Duke to found an African American Cultural Center, much as I might be ALL for more cultural centers.

You know nothing of what you're talking about. The group is called GLAAD and they don't speak for all gays. I am gay and I love Gutfeld's show. It's brilliant satire. He is a Libertarian who supports gays in the military and is not opposed to same-sex marriage. GLAAD called him anti-gay because he refuses to exempt gays from his jokes. His twisted and clever sense of humor is actually more equal and fair than PC phonies because he makes sure no one is off limits.

And he has already reserved a table for Rekers and Haggard, right "down front"

I am not be a conservative, but I am no fan of religion, which is why I will give that host a thumbs up!

I love Greg! He is one of the few in the media who tells it like it is. The way the clerics and muslim faith treats gays and women is appalling! It's quite amazing how the media fails to address this. Thank you, Greg.

You realize you could have substituted the word "Christian" for "Muslim" and your statement would still work. So let's help Greg to open up gay bars near every church in America as well.
 
Unless, of course, what he really wants to do is cause offense to one particular faith. In that case he is just a bigot.

Fanned. I wish I had the kind of disposable income to support an initiative to open up a gay family support center ala PFLAGG or similar near every virulently anti-gay house of worship in America. Wonder if Mr. Fox News smarm would step up to support THAT? Never mind, I know -- he just wants obnoxiously drunks swilling and hopefully indulging inappropriate PDAs to **** off the neighbors. What a devoted friend, truly, is Mr. Gutfeld to the gay community.

I'm sorry, how bad to Christians treat women? As far as I know there is no Christian Burqa. Christian women are allowed to freely go where they please without a make family member. If she commits adultery she will not be stoned to death.

Sorry, you simply can't compare Christianity to Islam in terms of hatred toward gays. Christians in the 21st century do not hang homosexuals. And everyone seems to be missing the point. Gutfeld's point is that if Islam won't respect the sensitivity of all the 9/11 families (in the supposed name of tolerance and outreach) then those who plan on building the mosque should expect the same.

Why did my comment get removed (I will reword it here): we should add all "religious" names as adjectives to a violent or criminal act (i.e. Christian terrorist, Christian serial killer, Jewish bank robber, etc.[streotype]).
 
Let us even the playing field, so to speak. Heaven forbid that we leave one's religion out of the description.

Quaker terrorists?

They drive horsecarts into buildings...

Muslim Terrorists earn their label because they commit acts of terror in the name of Allah. If they were just pissed off at somebody the fact they are Muslim would be irrelevant.

Would it not be wonderful if this backfired? The gay community (hated) and the Islamic community (ditto) just may find common ground and come together.
 
What a wonderful plan.

He hates Islam and the idea of this mosque. No surprise he's filled with hatred toward gays.

Personally I think he protests a little too much against gays and lesbians.
