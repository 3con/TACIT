
    Cant let em build it, no no no no no no, growls Trade Martin, the papa grizzly singing this anthem opposing the Cordoba House/Ground Zero Mosque. Theres a painful memory in our minds. Listen to this terrible, cacophonous nightmare of a song, and you will also have a new, painful memory, for your mind. The songs only redeeming quality is that it makes your Wonkette want to buy a new Ford 44 truck to drive aimlessly through rugged mountainous areas while eating Slim Jims and drinking Mountain Dew by the gallon, which would help the economy.

                We??ve got ??Freedom Of Religion??, I understand
                But Ground Zero is one location,
                where a Mosque shouldn??t stand!!!
 
                (Chorus)
 
                We??ve got to stop the Mosque at Ground Zero
                From thumin?? its nose at every victim and hero
                Thousands of Americans died in the attack
                It??s a sacred place, and that??s a cold hard fact
 
                There??s a painful memory in our minds
                Our hearts keep breakin?? when we envision that tragic time.
 
                (Chorus)
 
                God help us retain the honor and trust
                For all the families?., who have suffered so damn much
 
                Many Innocent Americans were killed
                If we let them build it, cant you see
                Theyll turn 9-11 to a mockery
 
                (Chorus)

                I was just thinking that what America really needs to bring us all together is an upbeat celebration of the deaths of 3,000 people and the subsequent narrow-minded paranoid religious eliminationism that pervaded our approach to anything remotely foreign.  It really unites us as a people to know that when the going gets tough, the tough lash out at the nearest brown person trying to assimilate into our vast and welcoming culture.

                Before this wonderful tune I was fer the Muslin building but now Im agin it. It was so catchy I hung up the disco ball from my ceiling fan, threw on my roller skates, and turned my motherfucking living room into a jerry-built discotheque. That song really stirred up something in me. Or perhaps it was the rum and blow. I bet it was the song though!

                The showing of first responders should be outlawed by anyone who votes Republican.  (See Anthony Weiner yelling at the GOP for why.)  The talk of the families should be outlawed for anyone in favor of wore (2001: Manhattan protests attacks on Afghanistan; 2003: 500,000 protest the Bush plans for Iraq war on Feb. 14; 9-11 families groups begun to stop these assholes from turning 9/11 into a war warrant).
 
                I understand we got freedom of speech
                But 9/11 aint a banner for leeches

                I mean that.
 
                I could deal.  I had to DO things.  I could go pull rubble (didnt), had to worry about the air, could run, etc.  In other words, those of us who were actually there had living and the demands of survival that took the front seat and allowed us to put the fear on the back burner.  All those other people, though, were not there: they were in front of the TV.  They had the worst seat in the house, and they couldnt do anything.  So: most horrible images + complete impotence = ?
 
                Therefore I propose: Proclamation: Ground Zero is a television channel.  From now on, a special channel will show a devastated hole in the ground, a ruined wing of the Pentagon, and a burned field.  This will remain unchanged and unchanging forever, with no one but respectful mourners of appropriate decorum parading past.  Since the real ground zero has people in it, real people who have petty commercial fights (hows the memorial coming?), real people who are trying to make a buck, stay alive, and do their business, ground zero should be on TV, where it can be kept safe.

                I myself was in OK, watching the whole thing unfold on the aforementioned television, and remember thinking how weird it was watching the replay over and over and over and over and over again. Surely, I thought, no one in Manhattan is interested in watching those explosions 5000 times in an hour.  Actually, its no wonder so many mouth-breathers are still angry and scared: it was seared into their brain with the force of an American Idol finale.

                LimeyLizzie, I couldnt disagree with you more. Just because you have the bad taste and poor judgment to live in what may well be North Americas most unpleasant city, that doesnt give you any particular insight into what happened on that day or make your input more valid on how the whole thing should be dealt with.

Anyway, these self-hating muslims who apparently hold their own religion responsible for 9/11 are flying into (the towers of) New York today to argue their case.

                Not merely content with being on the wrong side of an issue, it seems they always have some talent-free hack waiting in the wings to let fly with a drizzling fart of a tune like this. Isnt there a greedy soulless asshole out there with some ability who can at least pop out something awful (but clever and catchy)? They seem to be able to draw the hoopleheads in with all of their other rhetorical devices, but never can make music work for them. You would think they could find someone to be their anti-Dylan or their anti-Pete Seeger or their anti-Woody Guthrie. But this asshole and Ray Stevens (who is Reaganlike in his senility as well as beliefs) are the best and brightest of the lot.

                Unlike the Islamic Center, this song IS NOT protected by the First Amendment. On the contrary, Conspiracy to violate rights is a Federal Felony as is INCITING OR ATTEMPTING TO CAUSE a conspiracy to violate rights. (Federal Statute 18 USC 241)
 
                (i.e. Organizing a cross burning is a conspiracy to violate rights. Writing a song telling people we should get together and burn crosses is inciting or attempting to cause a conspiracy.)
 
                Not only should Trade Martin be sued, but he and everyone involved in the making and promotion of this song and video should be indicted by a Federal Grand Jury, which I would personally love to see. Perhaps sitting in Leavenworth for a few years will teach them the meaning of the word FREEDOM.
 
                At least 59 Muslims died on 9/11 including children and pregnant mothers. The World Trade Center was attacked by Al Quaida. The Islamic Center is being built by Americans. Therefore, who is this They this song speaks of?
