      - Democrats are letting nerd freshmen from tough districts put their names on all the best laws, as part of the partys long-standing policy of sticking up for the underdog. [WP]

                    Birthright citizenship was all well and good until filthy Messicans started dropping anchor babies on this side of the border. (Finish the dang wall!) The only thing I want dropping anchor is more oil rigs in the Gulf of America  drill, anchor baby, drill.

                    As much as Im digging the headline Josh; I was looking forward to an expletive rich discussion on the potty mouthed flight attendant who has left his job in a most envious way.

                    So, Scott McInnis settled his plagiarism issues for $300,000 paid back to the foundation after feigning innocence for over a month, and Dan Maes (who is a ridiculously terrible candidate the more you look into it) is sticking steadfastly by his bike sharing as sign of UN New World Order style control comment, and Tom Tancredo has been a full on lunatic for years.  As someone who lives in Denver, and who has family working with Denver Public Schools, it is a shame to see the board get dragged into the primary fight between these two dems, when they should really be focusing on how letting the republicans take back one of our senate seats would be an epic disaster.  Particularly when you consider that the two republicans are Jane Norton, a hilarious shill for business, and Ken Buck, the tea party candidate.  (No candidate should need more disqualification than simply being the tea party candidate.)  If you guys need more funny Colorado political scandal, the whole Douglas Bruce contempt of court issue is pretty damn funny.  Also, we have to vote on an amendment that would very literally redefine every fertilized human egg as person, for the purposes of making abortion legally into murder.  Ironically, this was attempted 2 years ago and got a whopping 27% of the vote, but they have again successfully petitioned to get it on the ballot.

                    Enacted during Reconstruction by a Republican Congress, the 14th Amendment officially overruled the Supreme Court??s infamous Dred Scott decision and defined citizenship not only for newly enfranchised blacks but for all Americans.
 
                    I wonder if the folks pushing to change the 14th amendment know its history.  Then again, they may actually agree with the Dred Scott decision, that a person of African ancestry cant claim US citizenship.  It fits in well with the whole birther argument.

                    One opponent of anchor babies is birthright citizen Michelle Malkin. Wingnut hypocrisy alive and well.

                    The GOPers and their Teabagger tard keep trying to open this big ugly can of worms, but will soon regret it when the Native Americans deport all their asses back to Ireland, Scotland, or Germania.

                    Heres one for you to file in the how to not win a state election category from the Denver Post:
 
                    Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Maes on Thursday said that if elected, he would lay off 2,000 state employees just like that, despite the fact that many of those terminations could be prohibited by state laws and rules.
 
                    It is a good year to be a Democrat.

                    What could be funnier for Colorado than a Dick WADhams running for anything.
 
                    History of the Dred Scott decision, that would require some fancy communist book learning and as we know Sarah isnt in favor of that. Although, she is in favor of the constitution, at least she says so, very confusing listening to Sarah.

                    What I dont get is why the Republicans think pushing to dump the 14th Amendment is a good political move; anyone whos racist enough they want to dump birthright citizenship is probably going to be voting Rep already.

                    In Georgia, there is only one Democrat in a run-off, and its Secretary of State.  Anyone want to bet on the vote total?  (These are closed primaries, so the GOP, which has this bitch slap fight going on, will have its nuts on the ground, but they cant vote for the Demrats, and Democrats cant vote for the nuts.)  Ive got a bet on under 50,000, state wide.
 
                    In Colorado, I bet Tancredo wins the GOP primary as a 3rd Party candidate, because he wants to.

                    Yes, that means that theyre going to arm the unborn!  There is no reason that children cannot have pistols in utero to defend themselves against their villainous abortionist mothers and baby killer doctors.

                    From Maes website:  Early Life:  Unfortunately, alcoholism took Dan??s father, first in the form of divorce and ultimately by ruining his health. His father died shortly after Dan turned 10.  Dan did not let this sad event dictate his course in life.
