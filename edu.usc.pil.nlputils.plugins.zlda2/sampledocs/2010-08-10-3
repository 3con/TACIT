 
Hate Group Places Ads on NYC Buses
 
The New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority approved an ad submitted by the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) displaying a mosque at Ground Zero with images of the Twin Towers burning and a plane about to crash into one of the towers. The MTA approved the ad only after the AFDI filed a lawsuit several months after the ad was initially submitted, and acknowledged that the ad was only permitted because of the First Amendment. The AFDI is run by prominent right-wing blogger Pamela Geller.

Like various right-wingers unsuccessfully attempting to prevent the building of Cordoba House (the so-called "Ground Zero Mosque", which is a community center with only a small prayer area), which received approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission last week, Geller shows no concern for New Yorkers:

Asked if she was concerned that the image of the flaming twin towers might upset some New Yorkers, Ms. Geller, in a brief interview on Monday, replied: Not at all. Its part of American history.

She similarly denied the ad was offensive. (Warning: The link to the denial includes a picture of the ad. Many, if not most, people will find the image offensive.)

Upon seeing the ad, I can conclusively say that Geller is wrong about it not being offensive. As a New Yorker I find it offensive to use 9/11 in such a political manner. As a New Yorker that believes in tolerance, freedom of religion, and the First Amendment, I find it offensive as nothing more than bigotry attempting to take advantage of our worst fears and promote hatred and intolerance against my fellow New Yorkers that happen to be Muslim. And as a Jew that knows all too well the history of my own people, I cannot tolerate such bigotry and hatred.

Despite the offensiveness of the ad, I decided to investigate the website the ad promotes, which is for a group called Stop Islamization of America (SIOA). (I refuse to link to the site directly because I consider it a hate group. However, if fellow Kossacks believe it is acceptable and/or advisable to do so in this instance I will reluctantly provide a direct link.) SIOA describes itself as follows:

SIOA is a human rights organization dedicated to freedom of speech, religious liberty, and individual rights; no special rights for special classes.

However, it is nothing more than a hate group that calls Cordoba House the "Ground Zero Mega Mosque", and has links to feeds with organizations sharing similar names in other countries ("Stop Islamization of X").

They also have headlines such as the following:

Ground Zero Imam Raufs Charity Funded Genocide Mission State Department Mulls Terror Designation For Group

and

SIOA Mosque Manifesto: All Mosques are Not Created Equal, A Handy Guide to Fighting the Muslim Brotherhood

Doing a little investigating on their site I easily found out they were linked to David Horowitz. SIOA's executive director, Robert Spencer, is director of Jihad Watch at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.

They also have a proclivity for newspeak, referring to "pro-freedom sites", "freedom bus ads" (in San Francisco), "New York City Freedom Bus", "freedom taxis" (in Chicago), and have a category called "Let Freedom Roll". Apparently freedom does not include the right of a religious group to build a community center that includes a prayer room.

I know this is a small, or perhaps at times not so small, corner of the internet, but if you're in New York or any other place, and you see these ads, note when and where you saw it, and contact elected officials to tell them while these ads are protected by the First Amendment (because we actually do understand the meaning of freedom and believe in it), that such hatred and bigotry should not be tolerated in the United States of America.

while these ads are protected by the First Amendment...such hatred and bigotry should not be tolerated in the United States of America.
The first amendment compels us to tolerate them, doesn't it? That's what it's there for.

Rather than contacting elected officials to try to squelch speech, I'd suggest engaging in more speech by contacting newspapers, donating to the ACLU or other orgs, etc.

I make it clear that we should support their right to do so, but by contacting elected officials we are letting them know that, we, the voters, do not tolerate this, and therefore it would hopefully change their public behavior.

What exactly would you expect the elected official to do. Any action from his/her position would be a violation of free speech (i don't know about legaly, but certaily the spirit of free speach).
 
Also let's not forget that the MTA took the exact same possition when the shoe was on the other foot. In 2009 when there was an atheist ad campaign atheist ad campaignthat came under heavy fire they stood by free speach and let the ads remain

I'm an absolute believer in Voltaire and Evelyn Beatrice Hall's, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."

I also fear that this group is stepping gleefully over that fine line between free speech, and yelling, "Fire!" in a crowded theater. I'm heartsick, and am dreading the inevitable hate crimes that will follow this craven manipulation of the First Amendment.

I'm sick and tired of these "persecuted" Christians.

Government promotion of our version of Christianity = freedom of religion.

Legitimate questions about said promotion = persecution.

Any other religion but ours = evil, unAmerican, terrorists.

Respecting constitutional rights of other religions = persecution.

And, the have the nerve to call themselves the American Freedom Defense Initiative.

I call them UnAmerican, hateful, bigots.

optimistically (I guess it's part of being a liberal), but I think the reason the right is getting more and more like this, and more and more overt in their bigotry, is they see my generation and they see they've already lost the culture war. Maybe this is the beginning of the right's last stand.

and it also seems that just when we think the right-wing crazies are done, they're never quite done.

There was the lawsuit after Cordoba House was approved by the LPC last week filed by Pat Robertson's ACLJ (and I have to wonder if they came up with acronym before naming because it's only one letter off from a very fine organization that does much good work), and now there's this, although granted it had been in the pipeline several months.

It just seems as though they keep on coming and coming, irrespective of the fact that we New Yorkers just want them gone already.

and that type of imagery is designed for one reason, and one reason alone: to inflame hatred and bigotry. It's a disgusting ad, but it's protected by the 1st Amendment because the MTA is a public agency, so I would defend their right to have these ads at the same time I'm condemning their bigotry here because I actually believe in freedom, believe in the 1st Amendment, and believe in what those two things mean.

BTW, they mentioned "freedom bus ads" in San Francisco on their website. Have you by chance seen any of these ads?

haven't been in for about a month. I haven't had a chance to see any of that. You know the one thing is that I don't know if it is a "free speech" issue.. I don't know the law but isn't there something about "Truth in Advertising". I may be wrong or not understanding of the legal issues.... so forgive my ignorance. But I know in sales I cannot just outright lie - yet that is exactly what they are doing... .

- ()
, ,

Sales is more regulated and there are truth in advertising restrictions because, generally speaking, commercial speech does not have the same protection under the 1st Amendment that other speech does (and in fact, until less than 40 years ago, commercial speech wasn't even considered protected under the 1st Amendment).

This is outright political speech and because there are public agencies involved unless there's some law being violated (like obscenity) it's going to be very tough to stop it. A somewhat similar analogy would be the Nazis marching in Skokie. It was offensive as hell, but they had a 1st Amendment right to do it.

"No special rights for special classes."

To me, that means equal rights for all...freedom to associate, marry, believe (or not), equal protection for everyone under the law.

Which, I'm sure, is quite the opposite of what they intend.
