Myths

> Tea Party'ers are not more likely to have racist tendencies than other conservatives.

(Except they are.)

> Democrats are scheming to hit 94 percent of small business owners with tax increases.

(Except they aren't.)

> Bloody violence is out of control along the Mexican border, and illegal immigrants are streaming into America at record levels.

(Except it's not and they're not.)

> Obamacare will send Medicare spiraling out of control.

(Except it won't.)

> Marriage is a religious union that's all about procreation.

(Except it isnt.)

> Voters say cutting the deficit is more important than creating jobs.

(Except they don't.)

> Social Security is going broke, it adds to the deficit, and we have to raise the retirement age because people are living longer.

(Except it's not, it doesn't and we don't.)

> The earth is getting cooler.

(Except it's really really not.)

> Facts and logic matter to Republicans.
(Except I just snorted milk out my nose.)

Tuesday Words of Wisdom from the Right-wing Blogosphere:

This needs investigating, they may just let her drop out of that position and keep the racist doing paperwork, or taking the trash out....she needs to be FIRED !!!!! will follow up with FOX ,and let them find out about this... This is pretty much proof that NAACP allows racist in their organization. Notice that the news medias, abc,cbs,nbc is NOT covering this although they covered the tea party racist claim....

CHEERS to sweet tweets. After months of speculation and suspense, it would appear, according to The Nation (a fine publication to which you should subscribe), that progressives finally have a reason to celebrate truly, madly, and deeply:

WH (& others) indicate Elizabeth Warren 2 be nominated next week to head Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Kudos 2 all who worked 4 her.

If true, someone take away her nail clippers. For that job she wont be needing them anymore.

CHEERS to primary day! Here we go, kids---it's all on the line today in Colorado, Minnesota and Connecticut, with runoff elections in Georgia. The race I'm watchin' today is the Connecticut governor's primary, where m'buddy Ned Lamont has a real good chance of being the Dem contender. He's got an invite for you nutmegers:

After you've found your polling place, voted, and asked your friends and family to vote as well, please join me on Tuesday at 8:15PM at Testo's, 1775 Madison Avenue, in Bridgeport to watch the returns come in!

For information about how and where to vote, or to help out, please click here.

Good luck to all the progressive Democratic candidates. And fair warning: the voting booth pens have GPS chips in 'em now so swipe 'em at your peril.

OOOH ICKY ICKY! to sleeping with the slimeballs. Oh, lord, grab some popcorn and pull up a seat. Republicans is fightin':

The Georgia governor runoff careens toward an end Tuesday, and in the closing weeks the bitter fight between Republicans Karen Handel and Nathan Deal has become a proxy war among several leading 2012 presidential candidates.

In this corner: the primped 'n pretty dream team of Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney, who want Handel to win. And in that corner: the wielders of the jowls of death, Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee, who want Deal to win. So no matter which candidate wins, they both lose.

JEERS to separation anxiety. A huge "ice island" four times the size of Manhattan broke up with Greenland and is now careening out of control at .00001 mph. Why the separation? Some blame it on global warming. Others blame it on a fight over a groupie. (You dont even wanna know what it looks like when it trashes a hotel room.)

P.S. Schuuuultz!!! Find those iceberg aliens and lock them up in the cooooler! DIS...missed!

CHEERS (because we never jeer anyone on their birthday) to Herbert Hoover. Today marks #31's 136th orbit around the sun. He was in many ways an outstanding public servant---1928 southern strategy and awful presidency excluded---and he certainly upheld traditional Republican Values:

The president...preferred not to see the servants at all. The mansion's bell system was used to keep a distance between Hoover and the people who served him: Three rings announced his approach, requiring staff to hide in the nearest closet until he was out of sight. The same went for the groundskeepers, who found themselves jumping behind shrubs when the president was rumored to be nearby. Those staff members with an insufficient cloaking device faced the possibility of dismissal.
---From Secret Lives of the U.S. Presidents by Cormac O'Brien"

Go pay your respects here...very quietly from behind the bushes.

JEERS to whatever they're smokin' over at CNBC. Erin Burnett dropped by the Chris Matthews Show over the weekend, and during the "Tell Me Something I Don't Know" segment, she gushed:

"This week we found out mortgages were almost a record low for a 30-year mortgage. Home sales are still down. We cant get better without housing getting better. One economist out there, he said, 'Guess what? We're gonna see new home construction double in the next two years.' It'll be huge for the American economy. We've got Dupont, Move Makers, all of them saying it's possible this is doubling. If that happens, we're gonna be in a totally different place."

I'll preserve this bit of unicorn-petting in the mighty C&J archives and yank it out every Friedman Unit or so to check on its status. Prediction: Burnett and her "one economist out there" will wish I hadn't.

CHEERS to great advances in sodapopology. On August 10, 1889, Dan Rylands patented the screw cap for bottles. Very convenient, yes. But we still keep breaking our teeth on 'em just the same.

CHEERS to finishing the job. Ladies and Gentlemen, C&J Theatre presents our world premiere of Saved By the Speaker in its entirety without commercial interruption. Curtain up...

TOWN HALL MEETING ATTENDEE IN TRI-CORNERED HAT: "Ah'm pissed, I tell ya! Ah'm madder'n a hornet stuck in a horse's ass with nothin' but hippety Hoppity music! Congressman, I tells ya that Obama is a Marxist Communist socialist Kenyan Muslim spy who came here to destroy America and give it to Mexico! Whaddya got to say to that?"

TOWN HALL MEETING ATTENDEE #2 WITH POWDERED WIG AND GLOCK STRAPPED TO THIGH: "Ah jus' wanna know one thing, congressman. Are you treadin' on may? Are you treadin' on may???!! Nobody treads on may! You tread on may I tread on you...maybe with 'second amendment remedies' if ya know what ah mean."

[SFX: Congressman's cell phone rings]

CONGRESSMAN BOOGERSCHMEAR: "'Scuse me, folks, I have to take this call. Hello? Yes, hello, Madam Speaker. What? You need me to fly to Washington right away and vote to save teachers' jobs and shore up Medicaid funding? Yes, Madam Speaker. I'm on my way. Goodbye. [Click] Sorry, folks, but I gotta go."

BOOGERSCHMEAR quickly exits and yells from offstage: "Wheeeeee!!!!! I'm Freeeee!!!"

Thank you, thank you! And now that it's over, stay tuned for forty commercials in a row.

Four years ago in C&J: August 10, 2006

JEERS to red meat for Fox News. The U.S. and Britain are now at Terror Alert Level "Mommy!!!" as an apparent terrorist plot to blow up six-to-ten airliners is apparently thwarted. Officials say all liquids are now banned in the cabins of overseas flights. Great...just what a passenger riding on a potential flying bomb needs: an empty liquor cart.

CHEERS to having the right stuff to survive the wrong turn. John and Annie Glenn were released from the hospital after getting in a fender-bender with another car last week. "I do not recommend you go test your airbags the way we did the other night." Okay...you convinced me.

-

And just one more...

CHEERS to C&J's little corner of paradise. Outside magazine is, um, out with its annual list of the Top 25 Dream Towns in America, and the #1 Shangri-la of the east is---[bats eyelashes]---why, it's li'l ol' Portland, Maine:

Portland is one of those rare places that really does combine small-town charm with big(ger)-city opportunities. But what we really love is the uniquely Maine mix of generational fishermen and young professionals, the latter lured here by the relatively low cost of living and (for Maine, at least) a diverse economy that includes everything from major financial and insurance corporations to media companies like our partner Outside TV.

Plus we've got a profitable Amtrak line, a hiking/biking trails system that's growing like a weed, a new hospital, an airport ("jetport," as we properly call it) undergoing expansion, schools getting makeovers, a thriving Red Sox farm team, microbreweries, and even a brand new (and admittedly inside) bowling alley right on the peninsula. Oh, and this is also worth noting: even though lead 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta started his deadly day in Portland, a permit was recently granted to a group of Muslims who applied to open a new mosque here---and no one batted an eye. (But please dont tell Gingrich or Palin. We really enjoy the quiet up here.)

Oh, and farewell to goddess Patricia Neal. She introduced me to the product that allows me to tolerate the rantings of Republican halfwits. Much obliged. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?

Cheers to kooperative kittehs. Last night we emptied out our bathroom, mixed up a gallon of some sulfur dip and proceeded to shampoo and dip all 5 of our fosters. This was the second go-round for Daisy but now her two remaining babies got the treatment as well as Larry and Miss Stephanie for their trip up to the shelter today for potential adoption. All of them were quite easy to do although my hands still have a whiff of sulfur stink about them.

Cheers to finishing cleaning up the church after FanFest. We always hafta "rechurchify" it which happened on Sunday but me and Mrs grog still have to take down the lighting fixtures, pull out the last of the cables and recylables. That only took about 45 minutes last night. Then we collapsed.

Jeers to the humidity. It's like a rain forest out there, only with an abundance of rednecks.

Cheers to Bozo! Here's a shot one of the FanFest attendees took of him out on the front porch of the Dauphine:
-

He's old and slow but will still thump his tail if petted, loves people and kittens and has been a perfect, albeit difficult at times, first dog for us.

Officially he's Bozo the Blind In One Eye, Three-Legged Dog With A Chronic Skin Condition.

He's 12. We've had him just over 4 years now. When he was perhaps 3ish, the UPS truck backed over him, hurting the "missing" leg. His previous owner was an old man and his old sister who lived 2 lots uphill from us. They had taken Boze in as a stray perhaps the year before, 18 months tops.

The leg wasn't broken, all nerve damage so the vet wanted to see if the nerves would regenerate. So Bozo walked around town for 8 months with this dead limb. It finally got infected and nothing was growing back so the old guy and his sister had it amputated. The wingnut, asshole, rednecks around here wouldn't have bothered.

It appears that the nerve damage from the accident also caused him to lose his site in his left eye.

The old guy and his sister weren't the cleanest souls on the planet plus over Bozo's last 2 years up there, his diet was mostly hotdogs, hamburgers and ice cream. Because he's got waay too much Shar Pei in him, it wreaked havoc on his skin and that's never fully recovered despite us giving him allergy shots, low doses of pred and frequent baths.

Whole societies depend on them for their income, political and secular power. Whole nations have been overthrown to increase their influence and power. Millions of people have been subjugated by them. Hell, millions of people have been tortured and murdered to keep them alive.

Myths rely on these kind of tactics to propagate and survive. The truth doesn't need them.

At the same time, lies is a peg-the-needle kind of word---and I do use it often. In this case I went with myths, which in a political setting like this means the same thing ("an unfounded or false notion"), but has a slightly less-jagged edge. I thought it might attract a few more eyeballs from casual visitors.

I'm probably thinkin' too much.

-

- ()

, , ,

... however, "myth" has another time-honored meaning: A framework through which we view our universe. In this case, it's a meaning-making conceptual framework. It's so much "in the wood-work" that we usually forget it's there.

The Greeks and Romans had their myths: The gods did it all. We - well, some of us - make use of a scientific "myth" or framework to understand our universe. [I happen to think it works pretty well, but I recognize it as a convenient organizing principal, not Truth itself.]

In this respect, myths aren't exactly lies -- unless and until we cling to them far beyond their intellectual usefulness.

the te-party ain't new!!!

in the summer midterms of 1966, richard nixon used pat buchanan and roger ailes to captured the angry dixiecrats who had pulled out of the democratic party because they insisted on maintaining racial segregation.

during that turbulent summer, ailes and buchanan transformed the republican party from the party that freed the slaves, the party with the first black elected officials to a more angry, racially intolerant, whiter, less educated group. the days of liberal, northern republicans were exchanged for all sorts of characters from the confederate south.

it is during those times when african americans completely turned against republicans. there is a great myth in this country that blacks prefer dems because of social programs--history does not support that assumption. while the racist dixiecrats were taking over the gop, the democrats were including civil rights reform in their platform. so, african americans have supported whichever party guaranteed them the most freedom over time.

fast forward to today because history really is repeating itself-- again. we have the summer of 2010, another midterm election season and some of the same players are on the scene-- roger ailes, pat buchanan with new players like beck, jan brewer, rand paul, sarah palin and sharron angle. they are seeking short-termed political gains at the expense of hispanics this time.

so, brewer started screaming early about how horrible the immigration issues are when in fact, there is lower crime, greater deportations, more troops and more resources than under bush. in fact, no republican president has ever done a good job with immigration issues and reagan really created the bad situation we have today.

so now, the republican party is "stupidly" creating policies that puts hispanics in a jim crow situation. we can all quit kidding ourselves and admit that police officers in arizona and viginia are not stopping paul from the uk who overstayed his student visa. they are not harassing christine from canada and certainly not detaining yaotang from china who is also illegal.

now, the dixiecrats (current day tea party) are even considering blowing-up the constitution to take even more hispanic rights away. many hispanics are not saying much but they are watching--silently in disgust.

theres a constant drumbeat on ailes big screens of hispanics behaving badly -- about hispanic with lower education rates and hispanic using social services and the fear of amnesty. think about horrors of amnesty, they are saying -- letting "those people" find a path to citizenship in "our country"! roger, weve seen that summer blockbuster before.

so yes, the tea party has replaced the dixiecrats with the great us vs. them election strategy. im sure just like 1966, scared white people will run to the polls to "take their country back" from all of the uppity big city liberal african americans and the growing influence of hispanics.

the fact that race relations will be set back 50 years doesnt matter--who cares-- its all about the novermber midterms.

fast forward to 2030 with a house that has 300 democrats, a senate with 65 dems including a hispanic president. our grandkids will be on some blog arguing about why 90% of hispanics vote for democrats. some t-partier will post: "they just want handouts."

however he will quickly be corrected by another one who says, "not so fast my friend."

And want to check out a cool, sometimes offbeat, occasionally funky, always interesting artfest next month (Fri & Sat, Sept 10, 11), come spend some time at Birmingham's ArtWalk, where Downtown/Loft District B'ham will be turned into ~150 galleries featuring photography, painting, sculpture, mult-media, and many, many other modes and methods of art-making by both novice and professional artists. It is a Juried show, so not "just anyone" can exhibit. Here are the Artists' Galleries from last year (mine's in there, too).

Self-promotion time: this will be my 2nd year exhibiting my photography at ArtWalk. Last year I got a 4th Place ("Judges' Mention") ribbon. Eh. The prizes stopped after 3rd Place. Still an honor, though.

My 2009 ArtWalk "mini gallery." 2010's not up, yet.

Various other Galleries of mine accessible here, of course (see the GALLERIES drop-down tab atop the page).

Thanks. Am going to do a "calling all artists" roll call diary by week's end. Never seen that up before.

What Google and Verizon are proposing is fake Net Neutrality. You can read their framework for yourself here or go here to see Google twisting itself in knots about this suddenly "thorny issue." But here are the basics of what the two companies are proposing:

1) Under their proposal, there would be no Net Neutrality on wireless networks -- meaning anything goes, from blocking websites and applications to pay-for-priority treatment.

2) Their proposed standard for "non-discrimination" on wired networks is so weak that actions like Comcast's widely denounced blocking of BitTorrent would be allowed.

3) The deal would let ISPs like Verizon -- instead of Internet users like you -- decide which applications deserve the best quality of service. That's not the way the Internet has ever worked, and it threatens to close the door on tomorrow's innovative applications. (If RealPlayer had been favored a few years ago, would we ever have gotten YouTube?)

4) The deal would allow ISPs to effectively split the Internet into "two pipes" -- one of which would be reserved for "managed services," a pay-for-play platform for content and applications. This is the proverbial toll road on the information superhighway, a fast lane reserved for the select few, while the rest of us are stuck on the cyber-equivalent of a winding dirt road.

5) The pact proposes to turn the Federal Communications Commission into a toothless watchdog, left fruitlessly chasing consumer complaints but unable to make rules of its own. Instead, it would leave it up to unaccountable (and almost surely industry-controlled) third parties to decide what the rules should be.

Those dopey scientists and idiots at time should have visited my house for the 13 years when my dear departed Lhasa Apso (aka Her Most Royal and Serene Highness) was running the place. It was brilliant.

For some reason, my stepdad had a dog training book laying around the house (as if my mom will ever let him get a dog) called "Smarter than you think" that advocated teaching your dog conversationally. The author pointed out that yapping "sit sit sit stay stay down down" at your dog is as boring for the dog as it is for you.

Cheers to finding a cookbook - housekeeping book from 1917 on the free book shelf at the coop. Its advice on giving clean food (boiled water etc.) to babies is right on but some its other baby-raising ideas are rather...peculiar.

to a baby as a pacifier.

- ()

Well, this book (unlike some others I've seen) does not recommend pacifiers of any kind and does not extol evaporated milk with sugar as the ideal baby food.

However, it does trot out the popular belief of the time that babies should be fed on a strict schedule and they shouldn't be picked up and played with becuase you wouldn't do that to an adult and babies just need their sleep anyway.

So basically you're supposed to bathe them, change them, feed them like they're little Army privates in a regiment and otherwise leave 'em alone. It doesn't seem like a system that would lead to secure or happy babies.

I am so mother f*cking furious about all of the hormones in the milk,cheese,ice cream and chicken that is sold at the grocery store. Not to mention the difficulty of finding things that do not contain high fructose corn syrup.

I can't afford to shop at Whole Foods and buy everything organic...so it takes me hours to shop at the grocery store for my family trying to find food that is not full of junk that will hurt my child's development.

Why is God's name is nothing being done about this? They don't have to add this crap to the food.

(AND...because of all the terrifying TV and news shows about the dangerous potential for child abduction, today's parents are afraid to let their kids out to play...so they don't get the exercise that they need.)

a few years back, I really noticed how early some of the kids, especially the girls were developing. Wasn't that way when I was a kid (though for the day, I went through it early myself but gosh, not at 7!!!!). Not only were they developing early, but one 6th grader got pregnant!!!! Craziness.

Vegetables wouldn't respond to the kind of growth hormones that they put into cows,chicken and pigs(do pigs even have trouble growing?).Cows are a real problem because of all of the dairy products...and the hormones pass into the milk.

I am operating under the assumption that these things are free of hormones: bread made from scratch. Vegetables.Fruits. Organic milks and cheeses. Organic chicken. Tofu. Nuts.

I think about the mickey mouse ears...the Disney logo..morphing into a black corset.
Disney takes a child of about 7 and gives them a TV show...then they make that child a "rock star" by age 11...what happens next... Lindsey Lohan.
Also, look at Miley Cirus. She is marketed to girls ages 7 to 12. But, then she releases "Untamed" and thrashes around the stage kicking everyone in her corset.
The problem is that those 7 to 12 years olds are STILL following her.
This is where little girls are getting ideas about hair color,perfume, pierced ears and make-up...from the shows on the Disney channel...many girls watch that stuff all the time because they are indoors because moms are too afraid to let them ride their bikes around the neighborhood and visit friends. I rode my bike miles from home when I was 7,8 years old. I just played outside all the time with NO supervision.

Cheers to, uh, oh, yeah everyone here. Sorry, I was distracted.

I would've answered the poll differently but "rolls eyes" wasn't a choice. Neither was: "Those capitalistic, greedy, slimeballs truly want to rob of us our information-gathering-diseminating capabilities for real."

Jeers to the proposed closing of the Camden NJ city libraries. I know it was announced here somewhere earlier, I just thought I'd reiterate it. Fools.

Cheers to pooties, puppies, babies and birdies. Cheers to my aunt who made sure there were people to watch her one neighbor (that suffers from beginning Alzheimer's and lives alone) while my aunt is away for several days. (Long, boring, rather painful story, but there you have it.)

Jeers to feeling depressed because the boys will be leaving for school this weekend. My baby's leaving home! This one's gonna be tough.

For all you folks looking forward to winter, be careful what you wish for. Just sayin'. So it's hot and terribly sticky here now. Yes, some of that IS because of the weather.

Have a good one y'all y'all. Keep cool.

a history of western civilization on iTunes U from UC Berkley--it's fascinating, but one thing she touched on (re: Myths) was the corporate-esque nature of marriage in western Europe in the Middle Ages. Not that it had nothing to do with love but it was largely motivated by alliances, and this when people were marrying older (avg age 24) and making choices on their own. Marriage has evolved throughout history. It's evolving again though making a much smaller jump, it seems to me. Cheers for marriage equality and cheers for iTunes U.

mostly (Archduchess Sophie, murdered in Sarajevo, was a commoner married for love, but that was an historical rarity though there were other instances). I wonder, how "sanctified" were THOSE marriages?

Boy, for a country full of straight people who sign pre-nuptial agreements and get divorced at the drop of a hat, people are pretty worked up over "protecting" marriage. My parents' generation made a total mockery of it. Of all the people I know my age, I know maybe three who's parents are not divorced.

Then, there's Newt Gingrich, serving divorce papers on his wife while she was in the hospital for cancer treatment.....

Just look at some of the power couples in the entertainment business and other professions, not to mention "old money" families. And then there are the uber good looking people marrying rich people to be live in prostitutes trophy spouses. Maybe there aren't as many "forced" marriages as there used to be, but it still happens.

How did you get hidden below "Today in Congress" so quickly? The old Rodney Dangerfield treatment. On Friday I was waiting for for Open Thread. I never saw it because it posted at at 09:00:01 PM EDT with this posting at 09:01:26 PM EDT?

Here in the Big Apple community gardens are under siege. Eliot Spitzer stopped Rudy from developing city gardens but there was an expiration date. That the big issues here and this green mayor has me very worried.

On JEERING those "words of wisdom" all I can offer is what one of my FoXNews watching co workers told me a few weeks back "The number one issue in America in is a black man standing outside of a Philadelphia election site with a black president unwilling to do a thing about it."

Sweet tweets indeed! As I CHEER my ass off for Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama and the people of the United States all I can think about is her emotional involvement with the people that was revealed in the final moment of "Maxed Out: Hard Times, Easy Credit and the Era of Predatory Lenders."

Note: The statement is all the way at the end so to see it you need to sit through gut wrenching stories and credits rolling to one very appropriate song.

For this election day being a New Yorker I'm feeling like a fifth wheel. It would be nice to spend my free time driving elders to vote but I have no connections in Connecticut and not even enough gas money to drive up there. I can offer this observation from the New York television market. On her constant barrage of TV commercials Linda McMahon still has not admitted what party she is from in her commercials. I guess people in Connecticut remember what party screwed up this nation.

In the Global Warming department, on the PBS Newshour last night there was an interesting segment about Democratic fortitude called What Happened to Democrats' Energy, Climate Change Legislation Plans? This line from Eric Pooley got to me.

I mean, three years ago, when I started work on "The Climate War," I thought that there was a good chance that it would have a happy ending. I knew it would be a political thriller, but what I didn't expect was that it would turn into a whodunit. And, in fact, it's a lot like a murder mystery like Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express," where there are a lot of people in on the killing.

Afterward I remembered a whodunit from my youth, the game "Clue." Yea I used to play it all the time back when Jimmy Carter was president.

I will CHEER Herbert Hoover too. Comparing him to McShame, he came in handy during the last presidential election.

JEERS to me. Sorry but I just can't be objective about Erin Burnett. I just wish she had chosen a more conventional form of acting.

For August 10th besides screwcaps, on this day in 1977 one of the most screwed up New Yorkers of all time got caught because of a parking ticket. To this day I'm asking how the hell did they not find David Berkowitz. The media said it was because a guy who was told by a German Shepard to go out and kill people "knew right from wrong."

Fair well Patricia Neal. I watched "Splendor in the Grass" last night. I still haven't gotten over the loss of Natalie Wood and I was feeling a little out of touch when I went to IMDB to see what Sandy Dennis has been up to lately.

It was Warren Beatty night and his movie from the year we lost Natalie Wood "Reds" was next. In that movie Maureen Stapleton played Emma Goldman and has this line;

I think voting is the opium of the masses in this country. Every four years you deaden the pain.

I don't know if Emma Goldman ever actually said that but the older I get the truer it sounds.

I had the wrong Wednesday on my calendar and I'm gong to miss the traveling Florida Modern-Day Slavery Museum.

 As the small pamphlet handed to tour-goers spells out, forced labor is nothing new in American agriculture. From the descendants of Africans who transformed Florida into a kingdom of cotton and sugar in the mid-1800s to the managers at US Sugar indicted in 1946 for holding farmworkers against their will deep within the Everglades, a long and painful history precedes the thousand or so farmworkers freed from involuntary servitude in the last decade in Florida.

 Even the tactics managers use havent changed over the decades, said Ramirez, whos worked in the Florida fields since 1996. Just like US Sugar, several of the recently convicted slavers had armed guards watching over the workers camp, which is typically far from town so that escapees have nowhere to go even if they find a way out.

 In the worst cases, the workers whole existence depended on supervisors or contractors, who were masters at keeping workers in both physical and economic bondage, deducting money for food and garden-hose showers ($5 each) from paychecks. Others plied the homeless from shelter job programs with promises of steady work, only to feed them alcohol and drugs and trap them in a cycle of debt and addiction. One boss took away workers shoes at night so they wouldnt run.

 The first prosecutions in recent years resulted in light sentences, around three years in jail, because district attorneys had to use laws from the post-Civil War era, when human bondage wasnt a settled issue in the South. Federal lawmakers responded by boosting penalties, so that a 2008 case resulted in 12-year sentences for ringleaders. But whatever the penalty, the pressuresand the profitsof the corporatized food system keep producing farm bosses and contractors who ensure their labor supply with force if they have to.

Too bad I want to see it and write a diary about the good people working for justice.

Here in New York it will be 95 today and I'm hiding out again. There is a chance of thunderstorms. I recorded "The Paralex View" after "Reds" and that's what on my agenda.

 Cheers to finally packing up a box of clothes to mail to a Native American Indian group.  Jeers that no sooner had I finished taping up the box than I found an item I'd forgotten about, one of the first items I bought specifically for that project but had put aside until I got more items.
 Jeers to fat spiders, especially when they crawl on my clothes (that's what I get for leaving my grungie clothes on the floor.) Usually I leave spiders inside the house alone unless they're on a food counter or similar, but these guys aren't even pulling their load by catching the moths and flies coming inside.
 Jeers to the cliqueish double standards around here. For example, when other Kossacks have posted reminders in Open Threads to rec the Gulf Motherblog to keep it on the RecList, their comments got numerous recs each. When I posted a similar comment in yesterday's OT after the motherblog dropped off the RL, I got a grand total of two recs.  Yeah, I get that so many people ignore me because I'm boring, and I'm boring to them because I'm (gasp) practical and logical and argue for facts instead of hyperbole.

JEERS EVERLASTING to the usual morons, like, for instance the lying war criminals who are not in jail and who sleep well at night because they're psychopaths with no conscience, and to BP and their corporate execs of like-minded mentalities, and the idiots who say the shrimp and crabs and fish from the Gulf is or will be safe to eat because someone is "monitoring" it. Yeah. Right. I believe the shrimper before I believe corporations and their slaves, government officials. The shrimper interviewed on ABC by Matt Gutman said "I damn near cried..." [exact quote] when stirred up silt yielded the oil droplets (presumably covered in dispersant), which they showed in the video. The shrimper went on to say he wouldn't eat anything out of the Gulf and he wouldn't feed his family anything from the Gulf waters. ABC doesn't have that video online, dammit! It was shown on Friday, IIRC, and I think also repeated on the late news Fri. night (Nightline). By Sat. or Sun. "news" in the early evening, ABC had severely edited the video and made it sound like there was no big deal with the oil and dispersant and that the shrimp and fish were safe to eat.

I ask why he no longer stutters. I probably do, depending on the situation. But he hasnt stuttered here, so how did he undo his speech impediment, or most of it? Well, I thought about it. And its not a physical handicap because you dont stutter in certain circumstances. I came to the conclusion that it was a fear of the perception of the listener. Having too high an opinion of other people and too low an opinion of yourself.
