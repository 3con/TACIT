A local lady wig peddler brought down this Sarah Palin mannequin head for the real Palin  for does such a thing exist?  to autograph. Well, wouldnt you do the same?
 
    Palin used the vernacular Hotlanta to impress the easily-impressed crowd, and also seemed to outshine Handel with her undeniable star power, reports Thomas Wheatley of the Creative Loafing alt-weekly. (Disclosure: Wheatley is your authors far-flung co-worker, thanks to franchising magic.) But not everyone was creaming their Pajama Jeans over the Alaskan princess: Wheatley reported that this guy wanted a refund on her autobiography. Palin had him ejected from the premises and eaten by a bear she had brought along with her, for heckler-eating purposes, and then made fun of nearby CNN, to hurt its feelings. [Creative Loafing]

                Hate to break it to them but that head looks more like Lisa Loeb then Snowbilly.  (Not that more than 37 people in the country probably even know who Lisa Loeb is)

                Hotlanta has the same ring to my ears as Nashvegas.  Something we locals say to impress the tourists (Look, Madge, they speak their own jive~!) but which we hold in revulsion whenever they sidle down into the nearest tourist trap.
 
                Though in Palins case its more like a tourist twat, amirite fellas?  Up high.

                The LSM has now decided to use this brief encounter for another one of their spin operations. They claim I ?? wait for it ?? ??appear to roll my eyes?? when the lady tells me she??s a teacher. Yes, it??s come to this: the media is now trying to turn my eyebrow movements into story lines.

                Well, of course the dummy head is better than the real thing, because it doesnt keep chattering on mindless catchphrases and talking points with an incredibly annoying voice.

                Does it come with a string in the back of its head, or is it more remote controlled? Although in the picture, it looks like Green Hat Lady has her hand up its butt.

                Someone needs to tell Sarah that in Atlanta Hotlanta was better known as a gay circuit party called the Hotlanta River Expo; traditionally held this time of year  Think drag-queenes, party-boys & bears all in short-shorts floating down the Chatahoochee river with lots of disco-dancing in your underwear thrown in for good measure and you have a good idea of what Hotlanta is about.

                This kind of follows the phenomenon that Tina Fey actually looks more like the OLD Swag-Hag (two years ago) before all the professionals got hold of her than the Swag-Hag looks like herself !!

                She played at my club back in the mid-90s ?? it was a Tuesday, she was on keytar, some dude who doubled as her roadie on drums, and five alcoholic activist bull dykes and a bartender were the entirety of her audience. I spent the entire depressing set in the bathroom doing blow and beating off.
 
                I saw her again a few years ago at the TED conference ?? she performed a rather enjoyable little acoustic act with SNL-alumn and cancer survivor Julia Sweeney. I ran into both of them afterwards, and even though I reminded her of the aforementioned killer show, she still was sweet enough to give me a little kiss and an autograph. (Alas, not on my head ?? Id foolishly left it back at the hotel.)

                The Sarah Palin disembodied mannequin head that will live on throughout the ages belonged to one Dianne Moore, a McDonough resident who told me she sells Raquel Welch wigs at her wig shop. The former vice-presidential candidate signed the head. Moore was very happy.
 
                So, dianne Moore doesnt give good heads?
