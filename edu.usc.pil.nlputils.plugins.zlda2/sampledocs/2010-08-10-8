Top American Rabbis Rally Behind the 'Ground Zero Mosque'
 
  -
  -

When I told a friend that I had helped found Religious Freedom USA to affirm the right to build the Park 51 community center in Lower Manhattan (often mislabeled the "Ground Zero Mosque"), he responded with a cautionary note: "What about the risk you are taking in your future career as a rabbi?"

Risks there may be, but many of America's top rabbis -- people I have looked up to for years and can only hope to emulate -- have in recent weeks rallied behind the Park 51 center. They have put their careers on the line to protect religious freedom and pluralism, even when it is another religious community at risk.

Rabbis have shown support through a number of different avenues, from newspaper articles to petitions, vigils and endorsements. Those who have shown support for Park 51 include: Eric Yoffie, President of the Union for Reform Judaism; David Ellenson, President of Hebrew Union College; David Saperstein, Director of the Religious Action Center; Ellen Lippman, co-Chair of Rabbis for Human Rights-North America; Irwin Kula, President of CLAL; Arthur Waskow, Director of the Shalom Center; Nancy Fuchs-Kreimer, Director of the Department for Multifaith Studies at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College; Michael Lerner, Editor of Tikkun; Burton Visotzky, Appleman Professor of Midrash and Interreligious Studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary; and Leila Gal Berner, leader of Kol Ami and founder of the Center for Jewish Ethics. And the list goes on.

Even as newspapers continue to flurry with the headline that the Anti-Defamation League has opposed Park 51, the leaders of American Jewry have come out disproportionately in support of the community center. The ADL is but an unfortunate exception to the remarkable trend.

Rabbi David Saperstein may have best explained why so many Jewish leaders (and their organizations) have shown support for Park 51:

    We Jews, as the victims of religious extermination and persecution, know all too well the pain that comes from being told that our community and our houses of worship will be treated differently than others.

Jews know intimately what it is like to be oppressed and to have the freedom to gather as a community undermined. We understand what it is like to be a minority on the outs. It is only in the past couple of decades that Jews have become more fully accepted into American society, and memories of how it felt at other times continue to cast a pall over our community.

I too am working to support Park 51 in honor of my heritage. My grandmother -- my mother's mother -- grew up in New York. She remembers vividly the night that an angry mob ran down her street yelling "Death to the Jews." Her family stayed inside with doors locked and windows bolted. Thankfully, they made it through the night unscathed. Even so, she tells the story three quarters of a century later with a gripping sense of immediacy. It was probably the most terrifying night of her life.

I would hardly do honor to her life and her experience if I ignored the chants against Park 51 and the American Muslim community -- even when they take place on the blogosphere. As a Jew connected to the past of my people, and my family's experiences in particular, I feel religiously obligated to support Park 51.

Thankfully, I have quite a few exemplars to join with in chorus.

Stuart Whatley: Democratic Values, Islam and the Judeo-Christian Tradition Fallacy   Models for pluralistic societies based on liberal democratic values exist throughout the historical landscape, independent of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It bodes well that they may be freely adopted by all cultures.

Rev. Chloe Breyer and Matthew Weiner: The Faithful Search: A Civics Primer for Real Patriots   The proliferating nature of these anti-mosque demonstrations and their shifting tenor to panicked claims about the imminent threats of "Islamization" and "Shariazation" begs a moment of national introspection.

Michael Rowe: Thoughts on the "Ground Zero Mosque " and the Better Angels of Our Nature   The part of me that initially flinched at the thought of a mosque so close to Ground Zero is not one of the better angels of my nature, and certainly not the part of me I'd ever want to be defined by.

Philip Smucker: Drink, Pray, Love: New Yorkers and Pacific Islanders Eschew Interference in Favor of Tolerance.   A strange tale from the remote Spice Islands seems oddly prescient today, particularly as I think of the cataclysmic violence that rocked New York City nearly nine years ago.

Russell Simmons: Ground Zero Mosque: Digging a Hole in the Soul of America   We are a pluralistic society and this means we welcome all religions. Islam did not attack the World Trade Center on 9/11, sick and twisted men did. They did not only hijack four airplanes, but also hijacked a religion.

Michael R. Bloomberg: Defending Religious Tolerance: Remarks on the Mosque Near Ground Zero   The World Trade Center Site will forever hold a special place in our City, in our hearts. But we would be untrue to the best part of ourselves if we said 'no' to a mosque in Lower Manhattan.

Stephen Elliott: Memo to the Anti-Defamation League: These Jews Don't Share Your Position   We believe the ADL's decision to oppose the building of the Islamic Community Center near Ground Zero is wrong, and that it goes against the ADL's description of itself as an organization that fights "all forms of bigotry."

i commend americas top rabbis for coming out in support of this mosque this is not a popular stand at this time

Every city in America should have a Cordoba Center.

No doubt there are some families that lost a loved one on 9/11 that in their grief and rage are opposing this center. As understandable as that grief or rage may be, we can't translate it into a public policy that paints all Muslims as responsible for 9/11 while at the same time completely ignoring the Muslims who worked in the World Trade Center or were innocent passengers on those planes. It's not good public policy and even more than than that it is both wrong as hell and a complete abrogation of those values of tolerance and religious freedom that we proclaim.
 
Those politicians who opposing this center to build political support on the Right are pandering to what is worst in us rather than calling us to be our best selves. Shame on them.

The group "September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows" supports the construction of the Islamic Cultural Center. See http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?id=977

The media likes to create the perception that Jews and Muslims hate each other. Fact is that Muslims and Jews have had a long, positive history together. Only the current day issue of Israel seems to divide Muslims and Jews. Anyway, most Muslims seek peace with Israel. But the media loves to focus on the few bad apples like the ADL or the president of Iran (whose views of the Holocaust are absurd)

You really haven't read the Qur'an, have you?

You really haven't read the history of Cordoba, have you?

"Fact is that Muslims and Jews have had a long, positive history together. Only the current day issue of Israel seems to divide Muslims and Jews."
 
When Muhammed was born Arabia was populated by Jews, Christians and traditional Pagan polytheists. There were no Muslims, obviously.
 
When Muhammed died all non-Muslims had been expelled from what is today Saudi Arabia (although Jews still remained in Yemen, as they did throughout what became the realms of the Arabs).

to c.w,
 
seriously there are courses and books on Islamic History. You need to read these books or take a basic course. Many of these books are written by non-muslims including atheists and agnostics. Your statements are absolutely laughable. I took Islam courses taught at my college (all my atheists/agnostic profs by the way) and you are basically out of the loop. A good start is AJ Arberry's Aspects of Islamic Civilization, also try Maxime Rodinson, a Marxist, a fairly recent one was Malise Ruthven's Islam in the World (guy is not that smart but still good) the list goes on and on and on

***applause*** for the courage and standing up against the bigots...

THANK YOU FOR YOUR POST, Mr. STANTON!
 Now...considering Rabbi Saperstein's position when he said: "We Jews, as the victims of religious extermination and persecution, know all too well the pain that comes from being told that our community and our houses of worship will be treated differently than others."
 Can you explain to us laymen, WHY ON EARTH, the ADL is so adamantly opposing this project?
 They claim to be in favor of tolerance [and against hate, racism and all forms of discrimination] but the inflexibility of their position on this matter [and on many others] argues against the very principles that the organization [at least, in theory] was founded on.
 Could you please, enlighten us on what is the ADL's REAL AGENDA?

I would like to believe in tolerance when it comes to religion. I will take the word of former Muslims who all say that these Mosques are used for a more sinister purpose. With all these moderate Muslims out there, where is a democratic Islamic republic? There is a reason the term "infadel" is used in the Koran. I think I will heed former Muslims, and be safe instead of sorry.

Exactly how would the geographic location of a mosque make you any less safe? If you really believe that "these Mosques are used for a more sinister purpose" you don't object to the LOCATION of this particular Mosque but to the mere EXISTENCE of ANY Mosque in the US. And, if that is the case, how can you claim that you "would like to believe in tolerance when it comes to religion" and post a comment so full of prejudice?

Oh yeah trust the "former" Muslims industry created by the Christian fundies. Get a clue. Most of these "former" Muslims have been exposed as frauds ie they don't even know the basics of Islam but claim degrees from Al-Azhar see "Mark Gabriel" BS

X2, couldn't agree more... I-hate-Islam for money is good business these days...

The word is infidel.

Yeah, that's right! Take the easy way out. Don't think for yourself or actually go and SEE what goes on in a mosque with your own two eyes. Just trust what some disgruntled, paid ex-member has to say about it. That's the way to get an accurate depiction of what's happening there! After all, the Qu'ran is the only sacred text that has a name for non-believers, right?

And this is a surprise?.. Jews are known for their disparate views on anything and everything.. just go to Israel and watch their political process.... its freedom of ideas and expression of thought.. more so than in America

This is refreshing. Jews have no great reason to love Muslims. But these rabbis have chosen to put away the hate and mistrust and speak out for the greater good of everyone through religious tolerance and equality. Peaceful coexistence and "doing unto others as you would have them do unto you" certainly trump hate and violence. Bravo for the rabbis.

I disagree with your statement that "Jews have no great reason to love Muslims" Sorry but you are not well-read in Islamic history. The Muslims treated Jews with respect and dignity in their lands. They only did so b/c Islam teaches us to respect the "People of the Book". Compare this to the horrendous persecution of Jews in Christian Europe.

see below

it's very sad to see your ignorance of jewish/muslim history. jews have every reason to love muslims. in fact the two faiths have been intertwined and have lived peacefully for the vast majority of history. start with andalusia or if you are feeling adventurous even with the advent of islam and its interactions with the jews of the arabian peninsula. it is very sad that this rift between jews and muslims has been created after the establishment of israel.

Mea culpa. I should have said, Jews have no great reason to love Muslims LATELY. You are correct. Before the Spanish Inquisition came along and started killing people, Jews and Muslims did live peacefully in most of Western Europe.

see below.

One of the reasons the mosque/center has been named Cordoba House is to highlight the spirit of Andalusia, a time when Muslims and Jews truly lived in peace, and in each other's protection, under a thriving economic period.
 
In fact, when the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) first learned of a nearby jewish community, he was excited to have found another group of people who worshipped only one God.

I apologize for misspeaking and marginalizing the great history Jews had with Muslims in Western Europe. I was speaking more in a modern sense with the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was a malapropism and I apologize. The point remains the same, however. Peaceful coexistence and respect is far better than hate and violence, which was the main thrust of my first post. Thanks, all, for keeping me on my toes!

TheKurgan, I appreciate your willingness to really listen to what others had to say about this and incorporate that into your worldview. All of us, Jews and Christians and Muslims and Atheists and Buddhists and Hindus et cetera, would love to see people of faith co-existing together. I believe that this is possible and I refuse to allow myself to become so jaded that I stop working to make this a reality. Together we can make this into a better world for us all. Maybe not a perfect world, but definitely a better one.
 
Peace
Pax
Salaam
Shalom
Good will!

Thanks to all the members and leaders in the Jewish community who have stood up to recent vicious and ugly against the attacks on American Muslims. I have said this many times on this website but progressive Jews and Muslims are in many ways natural allies and there are many issues where we need to support each other. Muslims need to speak out firmly against Anti-Semitism. And I am pleased to see how many Jews recognize the danger of Islamopohobia.
 
Ramadan Mubarak.

Ramadan Mubarak? I thought his name was Hose Me Mubarak. Just goes to show you learn something new everyday!

NYC Transit Authority has decided to permit a bus ad showing planes flying into the WTC next to a photo of the proposed Muslim Center - with the words "Why Here?" Imagine the response if anyone placed an ad showing the slaughter in Gaza next to a photo of a synagogue - with the words "Why Anywhere?" This inflammatory bigotry is the work of fear mongers who thrive and profit in the political arena when people are diverted from the real villains among us who sit back and laugh at their power.

Wow! I hadn't heard about that! It's dismaying, to say the least. *sigh*
